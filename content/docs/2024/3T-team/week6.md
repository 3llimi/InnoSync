### Audio Guide
This week, we added an audio guide to our mobile app. Mobile developers created a screen for the guide, and back-end developers created the content and stored it in the database. In the future, we plan to add the ability for users to select different voices for the audio guide and sync the text with the sound. However, this will be a challenging task.

### Travel Guide
This week, the guide's screen was completed. The design was changed to make it more attractive to readers. The text is now in markdown format and uses a consistent style throughout. Screens for each individual topic, which are pulled from the database, have also been added.

### Content
This week, all the content for each attraction in Innopolis has been completed and finalized. There is now an audio guide for each attraction, a short description, the date of creation, an address, and a complete guide with facts. In the future, it is also planned to create photo zones, reviews, and routes.
