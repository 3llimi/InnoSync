### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
Our project/application aims to create a convenient environment for exploring the sights. The relevance of this project can be seen even within Innopolis, as there are approximately 100 excursion groups visiting the city each day, all interested in learning about its famous places and attractions. We solve the problem of the inaccessibility of information that is of interest to tourists and visitors to our city (and in the future, to any city).

- Solution Description:
Our solution is to develop an application that provides users with a map of attractions, recommendations, and interesting stories, as well as the opportunity to communicate with friends. The app will contain detailed information about each attraction, allowing users to explore them in more depth. Additionally, we have decided to include a social network component to encourage users to interact with each other and share their experiences.

- Benefits to Users:
In addition to receiving information about the sights in various formats (audio guide, text, photos, etc.), our users will also have the opportunity to compete with their friends (achievement system) and post beautiful photos next to interesting places, write reviews, and of course, ask questions about various objects.

- Differentiation:
Our project is similar to the idea behind Yandex maps in many ways, but we specialize in attractions and provide not only a vast amount of information, but also an opportunity to ask questions. Additionally, we have a social network concept that will be more engaging for users than a traditional map with labels. Furthermore, we will implement an adaptive recommendation system.

- User Impact:
Our solution is specifically designed for tourists, as we help them save time and money on individual tours. We give them the freedom to explore independently and comfortably, without spending too much time or money. For many tourists, this is an important and necessary feature.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
Any tourist who wishes to visit Innopolis (or any other city), in theory, can find a brief overview of the attractions beforehand and decide whether they want to visit them. 
Another possible scenario is when a tourist arrives and is unsure of where to go. In such a case, we can provide them with a map and, if necessary, guide them along the route to their desired destination.
