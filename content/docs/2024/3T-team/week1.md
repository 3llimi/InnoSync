### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:\
Our project/application aims to create a convenient environment for exploring the sights. The relevance of this project can be seen even within Innopolis, as there are approximately 100 excursion groups visiting the city each day, all interested in learning about its famous places and attractions. We solve the problem of the inaccessibility of information that is of interest to tourists and visitors to our city (and in the future, to any city).

- Solution Description:\
Our solution is to develop an application that provides users with a map of attractions, recommendations, and interesting stories, as well as the opportunity to communicate with friends. The app will contain detailed information about each attraction, allowing users to explore them in more depth. Additionally, we have decided to include a social network component to encourage users to interact with each other and share their experiences.

- Benefits to Users:\
In addition to receiving information about the sights in various formats (audio guide, text, photos, etc.), our users will also have the opportunity to compete with their friends (achievement system) and post beautiful photos next to interesting places, write reviews, and of course, ask questions about various objects.

- Differentiation:\
Our project is similar to the idea behind Yandex maps in many ways, but we specialize in attractions and provide not only a vast amount of information, but also an opportunity to ask questions. Additionally, we have a social network concept that will be more engaging for users than a traditional map with labels. Furthermore, we will implement an adaptive recommendation system.

- User Impact:\
Our solution is specifically designed for tourists, as we help them save time and money on individual tours. We give them the freedom to explore independently and comfortably, without spending too much time or money. For many tourists, this is an important and necessary feature.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:\
Any tourist who wishes to visit Innopolis (or any other city), in theory, can find a brief overview of the attractions beforehand and decide whether they want to visit them. 
Another possible scenario is when a tourist arrives and is unsure of where to go. In such a case, we can provide them with a map and, if necessary, guide them along the route to their desired destination.

## **Lean Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address? \
   Our project aims to solve the problem of lack of information about the sights and important places in the city, as well as a lack of interest in exploring them. In addition, we provide information about any place, regardless of whether or not the customer has visited it, so everyone has the opportunity to learn about those places they want to visit in advance.

2. Who are your target users or customers\
   Our target audience is tourists of all ages who are interested in learning more about a specific attraction in the city they have visited or are planning to visit. Our application also provides information about places that are not easily accessible, so people who may not be able to drive can still access information, photos, and audio guides.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?\
   Before the start of the project, we conducted customer development, during which we learned exactly what people need. Customer development was conducted with tourists who came to Innopolis as a group or individually, with or without children. About 50 people were interviewed in May. Here is a list of the things we were able to learn:
   * We need a filter for attractions: with children and without children (for example, do not go to the theater with children, etc.)
   * We need the ability to build a route for several attractions at once
   * We need the ability to plan a route several days in advance
   * We need offline mode

   During the development process, we planned both a closed alpha test and an open beta test. For the beta test, we have already reached an agreement with a company based in Innopolis to help us. During each test, we will collect feedback and use it to improve our product.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?\
   Our project is primarily aimed at working with people, so the key factor for success will be the satisfaction of people with our application.

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback\
   In our project roadmap, there is time allocated for alpha and beta testing as well as bug fixes based on user feedback. In early July, we will have a week to test and add features based on the feedback and comments received. Also, in week 7, when the post-MVP is completed, we will repeat the process, but this time with real users.

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Our team has a strategic plan to leverage the following resources for the development and success of our project:
   * Experts:\
   In order for our application to be successful, it is important for us to understand what tourists want from their visit to our attractions. Therefore, before we started development, we conducted several consultations with tour guides from Innopolis. We wanted to understand the key points that tourists are interested in and what they want to see. Throughout the development process, we will continue to hold meetings with these guides to discuss how we can make our attractions more interesting for tour operators. We want to ensure that our application meets the needs of our target audience and is successful.

   * Open-Source:\
   The basis of our application is a map, and in order to successfully implement it, we use the Yandex Maps open-source API, which will significantly reduce the amount of work involved. Additionally, a variety of open-source libraries and frameworks will assist us during the development process.

   * AI:\
   Our project currently does not incorporate AI, but we plan to incorporate it in the future as a consultant for tourists. This will allow them to interact with the AI and receive personalized recommendations for their cultural program. The AI will be able to provide additional information about the attractions and events on offer.
