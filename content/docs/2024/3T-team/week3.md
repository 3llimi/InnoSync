# **Week #3**

## **Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**

- **Android Development**:\
    In terms of Android development for the prototype, our team was tasked with creating a functional map with markers for each landmark. When a user clicks on a marker, information about the corresponding point should appear.

    Our priorities were:

    1. Create a map that includes the boundaries of the city of Innopolis.
    2. Add markers based on the coordinates provided by the backend. Icons for the markers will also be retrieved from the backend.
    3. Develop a pop-up window that displays information from the backend when a user taps on an icon. This information could include historical data, the date of establishment of the point, and other relevant details.

- **Backend Development**:\
    As part of the backend development for the prototype, we were tasked with making requests to retrieve information that would be displayed on the application. All information was stored in databases, including user data, attraction data, icon data, and category data.

     Our priorities were:

    1. Ð¡reated databases for landmarks, cities, categories, and icons, as well as review files.
    2. Made requests to these databases to retrieve data for the application. The first request used the user's location coordinates to determine their city and returned information about attractions and icons in that city. After the user clicked on an icon, we transmitted all the data about that attraction.
    3. Filled the databases with relevant information.

- **Prototype Testing**:\
    The main thing in terms of testing was to check the clickability of the markers and how correctly the information is coming from the backend.

## **Weekly Progress Report**:

### **Challenges & Solutions**
During the development of the application, we encountered a significant number of unexpected tasks that required additional time for research and resolution. As a result, our team fell slightly behind schedule. However, after reviewing our plans, we determined that this would not impact the final outcome. In fact, we had allocated four days specifically for such unforeseen circumstances, so the team is continuing to work as planned.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**
We are sensibly evaluating our prototype and it is very good for 3 weeks of work, we have done a great job and we are not going to stop, we have already scheduled plans for the next 4 weeks and we are actively engaged in them.
Week 4:
    
- Registration (using Yandex ID)
- Create a profile for the user (screen)
- Creation of a database with user information
- Create a travel guide (after clicking the learn more about the attraction button)
