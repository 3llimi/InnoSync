### Week #4

#### External Feedback

This week, we gathered feedback from our mentor. He highlighted potential future compatibility issues with some of the technologies we are using in the frontend, prompting us to consider changes to our codebase to ensure long-term availability.. Following his suggestion, we also explored various AI APIs which we can integrate in our website, that can automatically generate product descriptions. This feedback has been instrumental in shaping our development priorities and guiding our iterative process.

#### Testing

Testing remains a crucial aspect of our development process. We are focusing on identifying and addressing any bugs or usability issues that arise. Although our primary focus this week has been on incorporating feedback and enhancing our code, we are continuing to perform tests on both our frontend and backend functionalities. This ongoing testing ensures that our product remains reliable and user-friendly as we make iterative improvements.

#### Iteration

Based on the feedback from our mentor and the results from our testing phase, we engaged in continuous refinement of our project. We started by addressing the potential obsolescence of our frontend technologies, we are currently refactoring the code to ensure it remains up-to-date and compatible with future updates. This has been a substantial effort,  we are working actively to ensure that our frontend code is robust, maintainable, and future-proof.

Simultaneously, we are also refactoring our backend code, focusing on scalability and performance. The exploration of AI APIs for automatic product description generation marked another significant iterative step, aiming to enhance our product’s functionality and user experience. This ongoing iterative process ensures that our project evolves to meet both our vision and user expectations.


### Weekly Progress Report

This week, our team worked hard to address feedback and improve our project. We had a helpful meeting with our mentor, who pointed out some potential problems with our frontend technologies. Based on his advice, we decided to review our codebase. This review showed us areas that needed improvement, so we started to refactor our frontend code to make it future-proof. This task has been challenging, and although we have some progress, we are still working on it. We are committed to completing this to ensure our code is strong and ready for the future.

We also focused on enhancing our backend code to make it faster and more scalable. Additionally, we explored some AI APIs to automate product description generation, which could greatly improve our product. We faced challenges with adding new products and setting up the authorization system, but we are working hard to solve these problems. Our efforts this week have been focused on these key areas, and we are dedicated to delivering a high-quality product.

**Challenges & Solutions:**

One of the main challenges we faced this week was the risk of our frontend technologies becoming outdated. To address this, we decided to review our codebase thoroughly. This review helped us find areas that needed improvement, so we started refactoring our frontend code. This process is still ongoing, and we are working hard to finish it as quickly as possible. We also had difficulties with our authorization process and adding new products. To solve these issues, we decided to also start refactoring our backend code. We will do our best to provide the best result

**Conclusions & Next Steps:**

In conclusion, this week has been crucial for our project’s development. The feedback from our mentor has significantly influenced our priorities, leading to major changes in both our frontend and backend code. While we have made some progress in refactoring our code, this work is not yet complete, and we are working hard to finish it. We are determined to see this through to ensure our code is strong and maintainable.

Looking ahead, our main focus will be on finishing the addition of new products and improving the authorization system. We will continue to enhance our design, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. Additionally, we will keep iterating on our development process, continually refining and improving our project based on ongoing testing and feedback. Our commitment to these next steps will ensure we stay on track to achieve our project goals and deliver a high-quality, reliable product.
