## **Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**

### **Technical Infrastructure**
We have established all necessary development environments and tools to support our prototype's creation. Docker containers have been utilized to ensure a consistent environment for all team members, enabling efficient coding and testing across different setups.

### **Backend Development**
The backend development has focused on integrating Pythoniq for blockchain interactions and setting up basic API endpoints using FastAPI. Core functionalities that support user transactions and data queries have been implemented, ensuring a robust foundation for our application's server-side logic.

### **Frontend Development**
Frontend development has begun with the construction of the main components based on the wireframes and designs prepared in previous weeks. We are using React.js combined with Ant Design for UI development to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. Priority has been given to building essential features like token swapping interfaces and user authentication flows.

### **Data Management**
We have set up a PostgreSQL database to manage user data and transaction records efficiently. The initial database schema includes tables for users, transactions, and token analytics, which support the MVP features of our application.

### **Prototype Testing**
Initial testing has been conducted to identify any usability issues or bugs. We used manual testing methods to ensure the functionalities meet the designed user flows and scenarios. Feedback from these tests has been collected for immediate refinement.

## **Weekly Progress Report**
Our team has made significant progress this week, completing the initial setup for both the backend and frontend components of our prototype. We have successfully integrated key blockchain functionalities and begun user interface development.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
- **Challenge:** Limited resources and documentation on advanced blockchain interactions specific to TON.
  - **Solution:** We conducted in-depth source code analysis and engaged with the blockchain developer community to fill knowledge gaps.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**
This week, we successfully laid down the technical foundation and began shaping our prototype. For the next steps, we plan to enhance data management features and extend the prototype's functionality to include advanced trading options and analytics tools. We will also continue refining the UI/UX based on user feedback and testing results.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Implement advanced token security analysis features.
  - Expand the testing framework to include stress testing and security testing.
  - Increase user engagement by introducing interactive elements and real-time data updates.
