# **Week #4**

## **Developing and Refining the Prototype through Feedback and Iteration**

### **External Feedback**
This week, we initiated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by engaging a select group of peers and fellow students who provided their honest feedback on our prototype. Their insights have been invaluable in assessing the usability and functionality of our platform.

**Positive Aspects Noted by Users:**
- **Design:** Users praised the intuitive and visually appealing user interface, highlighting ease of navigation and clean design as major strengths.
- **Transaction Speed:** Several users were impressed by the unbelievable speed of transactions, noting the seamless and almost instantaneous processing as a significant advantage.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Selling Tokens:** Some users reported difficulties when trying to sell tokens, mentioning unclear processes and the need for multiple attempts to execute a sale.

### **Testing**
With a functional prototype in hand, our focus shifted towards rigorous testing to ensure reliability and effectiveness. We conducted a series of tests. These tests helped us identify several bugs related to transaction handling and user session management which were promptly addressed.

### **Iteration**
Based on the feedback and testing results, we've made several iterations to our prototype:
- Enhanced the user interface based on user feedback to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
- Improved error handling mechanisms to provide clearer feedback to the user in case of failed transactions.
- Refined the data interaction layers to enhance performance and reduce latency.

These changes are instrumental in aligning our prototype more closely with the user's needs and our initial project vision.

## **Weekly Progress Report**

### **Achievements:**
- Conducted initial rounds of user acceptance testing.
- Identified and fixed multiple bugs in the transaction processing logic.
- Improved the overall performance of the application by optimizing backend queries.

### **Challenges & Solutions:**
- **Challenge:** When selling jettons, an error is thrown and the user doesn't see it.
  - **Solution:** Improve error handling mechanisms to provide clearer feedback to the user in case of failed transactions.
- **Challenge:** High latency in data retrieval was affecting user experience.
  - **Solution:** Implemented caching mechanisms to improve data retrieval times.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**
As we conclude Week 4, we are more aligned with our project's trajectory towards a robust and user-friendly trading platform. The next steps involve:
- Continuing to gather user feedback to refine usability and functionality.
- Expanding our testing to cover security aspects and stress testing.
- Planning the next set of features to be developed, focusing on advanced analytics tools for traders.
