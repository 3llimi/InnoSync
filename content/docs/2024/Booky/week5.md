#### Challenges & Solutions

- ##### Challenge 1: Iterative Rebuilds
    - **Context:** During the development process, we encountered the necessity for iterative rebuilds of the application to incorporate ongoing feedback and address newly identified issues.
    - **Impact:** These iterative rebuilds increased development time and resource consumption, causing delays in project milestones and creating potential inefficiencies in the development workflow.
    - **Solution:**  To manage the iterative rebuilds more effectively, we implemented a more agile and modular development approach. By breaking down the application into smaller, independent modules, we were able to make changes and updates more efficiently without affecting the entire system. Additionally, we adopted CI/CD, which automated the testing and deployment processes, ensuring that changes could be integrated and deployed quickly and reliably.
    

- ##### Challenge 2: Low Survey Response Rate
    - **Context:** Despite initial outreach efforts, we encountered a lower-than-expected response rate to our online surveys.
    - **Impact:** Limited data collection hindered our ability to gather diverse perspectives and comprehensive feedback from users.
    - **Solution:** Implemented a proactive strategy to increase survey participation. We sent personalized reminders to participants and introduced a small incentive program for survey completion. This approach not only encouraged higher engagement but also incentivized users to provide detailed feedback. By enhancing outreach and incentivization, we successfully boosted survey response rates, thereby enriching our data pool and improving the validity of our findings.

- ##### Challenge 3: Diverse Feedback
    - **Context:** Collating and interpreting diverse feedback from stakeholders presented a challenge in identifying common themes and actionable insights.
    - **Impact:** Without structured categorization, it was challenging to prioritize feedback effectively and align development efforts with user needs.
    - **Solution:** Implemented a systematic approach to feedback categorization and analysis. By categorizing responses into themes based on common issues and suggestions, we gained clarity on key areas requiring attention. This method facilitated the identification of high-priority features and improvements, enabling us to focus resources on initiatives that would have the greatest impact on user satisfaction and product enhancement.

- ##### Challenge 4: Lack of infrastructure for AI
    - **Context:** As our application integrates more advanced AI capabilities, such as text enhancement and analysis, the computational load has increased beyond initial expectations. This has led to slower response times and decreased overall system efficiency.
    - **Impact:** Users experience delays and sluggish performance when utilizing the AI feature, negatively impacting usability and satisfaction. Slower response times impede workflow efficiency, affecting user productivity and engagement with the application.
    - **Solution:** To address the performance issues stemming from the high computational demands of our AI feature, we plan to leverage cloud services to provide scalable resources that can dynamically adjust to fluctuating demands. Through proactive monitoring and scaling strategies, we aim to maintain consistent and optimized AI functionality, delivering a smoother and more efficient user experience while optimizing costs.
