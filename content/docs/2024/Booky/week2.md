## Week 2 Questionnaire

### Mentorship Support
- **Mentor**: No mentor currently involved.
- **Seeking Mentorship**: Do not plan to seek a mentor. We have the expertise required for the project development.

### Identifying Knowledge Gaps
- Regular team meetings, pair programming, and open sources are enough to fill knowledge gaps and address any issues in the project development.

### Engaging with the Tech Community
- Some team members find the following useful: participation in online forums, local meetups, and tech communities (Telegram, Discord, etc.)

### Learning Objectives
- Deepen understanding of software development. Focused study sessions, hands-on practice, and collaboration on challenging tasks are the point of our strategy.
