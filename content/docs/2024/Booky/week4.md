# Capstone Project Week 4 Progress Report

## Overview
This week is focused on testing, integrating feedback, and continuous iteration. These processes are essential to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, functional product that aligns with the original vision.

## 1. External Feedback

### User Acceptance Testing
User Acceptance Testing plays a critical role in understanding the usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction of the product.

#### Feedback Collection
- **Target Audience:** App Designers, Students
- **Method of Feedback Collection:** We prepared a demo to collect feedback on User Experience through open-ended survey questions, targeting users' pain points.

#### Key Insights:
- Update the app design
- Include AI features
- Prevent data leakage

#### Actionable Items:
- Make UX/UI trendy
- Include AI summarizer
- Add security mode

## 2. Testing

### Testing Activities
- **Testing Scope:** UI/UX, Basic functionality of the app
- **Types of Testing Conducted:** User testing, Regression testing, Unit testing
- **Testing Tools Used:** Google forms for conducting the survey, Google docs, Checklist making, Test cases

### Test Results
The app version is working correctly on most of the tests, which identifies the success of development of the prototype. However, some of the tests failed.

#### Failed Tests:
- “Click on the search bar to search for materials”
- “Enter the name of the course you are looking for, search”
- “Clicking on a notification takes you to the corresponding course”

### Identified Issues and Solutions
#### Issues Identified:
- Course cards were not informative
- Color theme seemed too old-fashioned
- The app did not use the power of AI
- Sensitive data can be accessed through the app

#### Proposed Solutions:
- Change course card visuals
- Update the color theme
- Include AI tools such as summarization
- Introduce access settings for sensitive data

## 3. Iteration and Refinement

### Iterative Process
- **Evaluation:** Progress was evaluated through team meetings, feedback sessions, and testing reports
- **Adjustments Made:** Change course card visuals

### Refinements Implemented:
- Modernized the color theme.
- Reduced the size of toolbar icons.
- Improved animations for smoother transitions between screens

### Future Iterations
- **Planned Iterations:** Further enhancements to UX/UI, implementation of AI summarizer, and security mode.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Improved user satisfaction, enhanced data security, and a more modern, functional app design

## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges Faced
- It was hard to face critique. When the first three respondents said the app differs from their expectations, it was hard to admit.
- Each iteration needs to be done fast. It was a problem to change the project even if the changes seemed large. Indeed, the changes in the app require changes in the testing and recollection of the users’ feedback, which can be boring and unpleasant for some.
- Balancing the feedback from different user groups while maintaining the core vision of the app
- The lack of specific project documentation was leading to difficulties in the testing

### Learnings and Takeaways
- Constructive criticism is vital for growth and should be embraced
- Agile methodology is effective in managing rapid changes and iterations
- Prioritizing user feedback ensures the product meets user needs and expectations

## Conclusion
This week was pivotal in advancing the project through external feedback, rigorous testing, and continuous iteration. The insights gained and refinements made have brought the prototype closer to the envisioned final product. Continuous iteration and feedback integration will ensure the project's success.

## Next Steps
- Implement an AI summarizer.
- Enhance data security features.
- Continue refining the UX/UI based on the latest feedback.
- Fix critical functionality issues identified in testing.

## Notes
- Ensure regular communication within the team.
- Maintain focus on the most crucial features and functionalities.
- Continue to embrace feedback and iterative development.
