# **Week #3**

## **Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**

- **Technical Infrastructure**:
  Our team is using [Innopolis Gitlab](https://gitlab.pg.innopolis.university/) for a shared development environment and
  everyone is familiar with the said platform. To speed up the initialization we have a file called launch.sh that
  initializes the system. We do not require any more Infrastructure for effective development, but may create a CI/CD
  pipeline to check for general tests.

- **Backend Development**:
  The backend part of our project is already in a state for a minimal value product, but we are constantly adding more
  improvements to achieve better security and a wider variety of options for languages and modifications support.

- **Frontend Development**:
  Our team has completed the barebones functionality of the current model of the website, but we still find areas of
  improvement and we are currently mid-way through creating a user-friendly look and implementing it. To see the current
  look of the website, please watch our video that you can find after this general section.

- **Data Management**:
  The current state of our data management allows for all the features that we were planning to use it for, but we are
  still improving our safety and creating more interactions that require tweaks to the system.

- **Prototype Testing**:
  The current prototype is working precisely as intended, without any deviations from our expectations, the available
  features are working in a stripped down version, but they allow for all the necessary testing and showcasing. For a
  more detailed look, please refer to the video we are providing in the very next portion of this report. As for
  refinements of the current abilities, we are improving every bit of functionality, but there is no significant
  direction to underline in this part as all parts are currently under some sort of tweaking to fit our view of the
  project.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

1. Creating a uniform style. Define the colors, fonts, and styles that match our product to create a consistent design
   for all pages.
2. Adaptive design. Using media queries to adapt styles to different screen sizes and devices.
3. Stylization of forms. Apply styles to various form elements such as input fields and submit buttons to make forms
   more attractive and user-friendly.
4. Animations and transitions. Using CSS properties such as transition and animation to add animation when interacting
   with elements.
5. Creating user interface elements. Using CSS to style elements to add interactivity to create custom interface
   elements such as buttons, shapes.
