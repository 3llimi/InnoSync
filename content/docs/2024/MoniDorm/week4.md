# **Week #4**

### **External Feedback**: 

Extensive user feedback was collected from classmates, who represent the initial target audience of students, after testing the chatbot application. The feedback received includes the following points:

1. **Response Issues:** Users experienced a delay when pressing old buttons, giving the impression that the bot is processing something, although it ultimately does not respond.
2. **Email Support:** The application does not support innopolis.ru email addresses, only supporting .university domains.
3. **User Interface:** 
    - The addition of an avatar is recommended.
    - The message "everything is interrupted, you are at the main menu now" appears ambiguous when the "/menu" command is activated.
    - A final message at logout is suggested to replace the current message ending with a multi-dot.
4. **Notification Preferences:** Users requested a subscription feature for notifications specific to buildings of interest, rather than receiving notifications for all buildings.
5. **Positive Feedback:**
    - The bot's name is well-received.
    - The system is generally considered user-friendly.
    - The controls are minimalistic and largely intuitive.

**Planned Improvements**

Based on the feedback, the following enhancements are planned:
- Implement mechanisms to handle invalid messages or clicks to improve user experience and responsiveness.
- Add an avatar to enhance the visual appeal and user interface.
- Extend support to include "innopolis.ru" email addresses for user login.
- Revise the response to the "/menu" command to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.
- Introduce a definitive final message at logout, replacing the ambiguous multi-dot message.
- Develop a subscription feature allowing users to opt-in for notifications specific to buildings they are interested in, rather than receiving all notifications.

Future feedback will be solicited from the hostel administration via the admin panel, which will include detailed statistical analysis to further refine and enhance the MoniDorm system.

### **Testing**:
Another important topic of the week - testing, which lies at the core of software development. It allows you to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of your prototype or application. By conducting thorough tests, you gain valuable insights into the user experience, identify areas for improvement, and address any issues or bugs that may have arisen during development. Need to note, that testing is a step that comes after having an already somewhat developed prototype. Prioritize the prototype over the thorough testing on the initial stages. Once you have a product that have all envisioned features, testing will be the next main focal point of your development journey.

### **Iteration**:
Continuous iteration is the backbone of successful project development. It involves a constant cycle of evaluation, adjustment, and refinement based on feedback and testing results. Regularly assess your project’s progress, comparing it against your initial goals and objectives. Be prepared to adjust and refine your design, features, and functionalities as needed. This iterative approach allows you to create a product that continuously evolves and improves, meeting the initially constructed vision. While it might seem challenging to iterate on the early version of the project - it is exactly the moment where most of mistakes can be eliminated. Make sure to use this opportunity and fully use an iterative approach while building your product.

## **Progress report**:
Throughout this week, we kindly want to remind you the importance of weekly progress reports. Document your learnings, challenges, and achievements. This weeks progress report needs to cover three main topics of the week, namely - 1) External feedback on your project. 2) Testing and narrowing the scope of the project. 3) Iteration and refinement.

To excel in Week 4, stay motivated, communicate effectively, and embrace the iterative nature of the development process. Foster collaboration and coordination within your team, sharing feedback, ideas, and solutions. Regularly assess your project’s scope and refine it to ensure focus and feasibility. By narrowing down the scope, you direct your efforts towards the most crucial features and functionalities, ensuring a streamlined development process.

Remember, this week is a pivotal point in your project’s development. It is an opportunity to refine and enhance your prototype, bringing it closer to the envisioned final product. Embrace the challenges, learn from the feedback, and seize the potential to have a prototype in only 7 weeks.
