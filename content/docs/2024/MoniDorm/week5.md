# **Week #5**
  
We have now entered **Week 5** of our Capstone project, a pivotal phase where we dedicate our efforts to an essential aspect of product development: continuously gathering feedback and refining our offerings. Building upon the valuable input we received from stakeholders from the last week, our primary objective this week is to expand our network of feedback providers in a systematic and organized manner. Thus, we are entering a second iteration of feedback collection. Remember, feedback - reflection - improvement is a cycle that can get you far. Therefore, think of the ways that you can make most of this process.

## **Weekly tasks**

To accomplish this, we will focus on the following tasks throughout the week:

- Schedule meetings or interviews with relevant stakeholders, such as potential clients, users, or fellow students, to collect feedback on the current product version. Remember, goal fo the week to have a broader feedback and better refinement.
- Prepare a feedback collection plan, including the specific questions or areas of focus to gather feedback on. Consider using an algorithmic ways to collect standardized feedback (online forms or online charts where users can quantitatively assess your product or its features) in addition to one on one meetings. 
- Conduct user surveys or feedback sessions to gather input on the product's usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction.
- Document feedback received from stakeholders, ensuring clear identification of specific areas of improvement or enhancement.
- Analyze the feedback collected to identify common themes, patterns, or recurring issues.
- Prioritize the feedback based on its impact and feasibility of implementation.
- For those who are willing to continue their projects after Capstone - discuss and refine the product **roadmap** based on the feedback and identified improvements. This can include feature addition plan for the next months or even a year. Time flies fast, and having a thoroughly refined plan is always better than just development on your feel about the product.
- **Implement necessary changes or enhancements** to the product based on the feedback received, following the project's development process.

By prioritizing these tasks during Week 5, our objective is to establish a robust feedback loop that consistently enhances the quality, usability, and overall value of your products. We understand that every project may encounter challenges along the way, and we want to emphasize that this week presents a valuable opportunity to address any major issues and make significant progress.

If you find yourself facing significant challenges or falling behind, we strongly encourage you to seize this week as a chance to catch up and realign your project trajectory. Reach out to your mentors and fellow team members for support, guidance, and collaboration. Leverage the resources available to you, to overcome obstacles and move forward with renewed momentum.

In addition to resolving any major issues, Week 5 is also an ideal time to take stock of your overall project status and ensure that you are on track for a successful culmination. Review your project goals, milestones, and timelines, making adjustments as necessary. Conduct thorough testing and validation to validate the functionality, reliability, and user experience of your products.

Note: Week 6 will be dedicated to preparing for the final presentation and packaging, so ensure that the feedback collected in Week 5 is fully considered and incorporated into the product before moving forward.

Keep up the great work and make the most of Week 5. Your dedication and hard work will undoubtedly shine through in the final stages of your projects.

## Feedbacks:

- ### Feedback collection plan

    After collecting feedback last week, we identified several ways to make the process more convenient for users and improve our analysis of their responses. As a result, we have used a slightly different strategy for gathering feedback from clients this week.

    Helpful tools we used:

    - Online Forms: We utilized Google Forms to create and distribute surveys.
    - Data Analysis Tools: We used Google Sheets to organize and analyze the feedback data.
