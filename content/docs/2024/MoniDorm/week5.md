# **Week #5**

## Feedbacks:

- ### Feedback collection plan

  After collecting feedback last week, we identified several ways to make the process more convenient for users and
  improve our analysis of their responses. As a result, we have used a slightly different strategy for gathering
  feedback from clients this week.

  Helpful tools we used:

    - Online Forms: We utilized Google Forms to create and distribute surveys.
    - Data Analysis Tools: We used Google Sheets to organize and analyze the feedback data.

- ### Conducted user surveys or feedback sessions

  <u>**Results of bot feedback session**</u>

  Our target audience consisted of 31 students, whom we asked to provide feedback on our product. They were instructed
  to send 1-2 reports to our bot. Following this, they rated the ease of sending reports, receiving notifications, and
  their overall satisfaction with using the bot. We then analyzed their responses from the Google Forms below.

  **Usability:**

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">

    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/MoniDorm/feedback_bot/bot_3.png"></div>

  If you encounter any difficulties while using the bot, please describe.
    - Old reporting windows are still active. But this is minor issue, does not break anything except command that can
      be sent at the state of optional comment
    - The time to receive a confirmation code on email is longer than in other services. Sometimes, buttons pressures
      are processed for a long time
    - Slow email confirmation, sometimes slow button reaction
    - It's not a difficulty, but I want to see a list of subscriptions somewhere. Just don't want to go through all the
      possible report options
    - I'd like to have a clearly understandable navigation after I log in
    - It could be great to have a bot feedback when I leave comment on problem
    - "Alerts enabled" — confusing little bit. May be name it as disable alerts?
    - When I press /start again after using the bot nothing happens
    - It could be better to have buttons instead of handling everything with / commands
    - Meniu buttons are essential for good UX in Telegram bots. I wish you will add them as soon as it is possible
    - Find subscriptions for the specific dorm
    - Some my messages disappear after I send them. It is not clear to me should are they being deleted

    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/MoniDorm/feedback_bot/bot_4.png"></div>

  What features or sections did you find most useful or confusing?
    - Optional report commenta may help to understand the core of problem imho
    - Useful that I can subscribe to obtain notifications about specific building
    - It is useful that I can just choose the labels and floors (don't have specific format for writing)
    - Notification system is very helpful
    - Reports summarization
    - Choice between descriptive and usual report
    - I find the bot very helpful! AI integration is awesome, the project is a success!
    - Little bit inconvenient to unsubscribe from alrrts
    - Get notifications about problems
    - Navigation to reporting the issue
    - Selecting the dorm is implemented very good! :)
    - Buttons (user experience in general)
    - It is confusing that some commands (like /start) that are send to the bot are being deleted. I want to have full
      history of my dialogue with the bot.
    - Inline buttons for choosing the dorm and kind of trouble are implemented very well.
    - Choosing the dorm using inline buttons is very cool feature!
    - Automated reports.
    - Do not delete messages
    - removing users' messages?why?

  **Functionality:**

    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/MoniDorm/feedback_bot/bot_8.png"></div>

  What additional features would you like to see in the bot?
    - alerts were received multiple times but this is probably ok
    - I don't know why my reports were not sent to me, but may be it is not enough
    - Maybe it will be good to upload the photo about problem
    - Tracking of my report (is it approved or no)
    - It could be cool to maybe have a map of the dorms and report locations on it
    - May be map of failures
    - Maybe notifications not only about problems that have already happened but also notifications about upcoming
      changes (about water shutdown and etc)
    - Buttons for more intuitive navigation
    - I received alert multiple times
    - Buttons as I said
    - Option to attach photos to reports
      nothing, i like it
    - Messages in reports could be more concise and informative
    - Do not delete messages
      update info on reports (if there are new ones)
    - Results on resolving reported issue

    - now bot alerts are not used anyhow, but they could be e.g. sent through dormitory representative to
      adminitstration
    - May be button interface in keyboard?
    - I like this bot! I think you should develop it for future.
    - Very good idea, because in usual way I know about outrages very late
    - Do such system not only for dorms but for university or maybe for city
    - Good project
    - Can this bot really report stuff to dorm admins?
    - I would like to have a feedback from bot after leaving the message on problem in dorm.
    - Sometimes requests are processed slowly
    - Fix the case with sending /start
    - The idea is very interesting, I wish it will speed up the processing of fixing troubles in dormitories! Good luck
      with the implementation:)
    - Simplify the subscription system
    - this approach can lead dorm issues reporting to absolutely new level! happy to see it
    - I have used your bot about a week ago and I see that user interface has been improved very much. Good job,
      fellows!
    - Messages should remain
    - I think it was better to make a website instead of Telegram bot
    - don't remove messages, it is strange behavior

## Roadmap:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/Monidorm/final-roadmap.png">
</div>

We will plan to implement the following enhancements:

1. **Extra Statistics with ClickHouse:** This will allow for more detailed and comprehensive data analysis.
2. **Horizontal Scaling with ClickHouse:** To improve the system’s scalability and performance.
3. **ML-Based Failure Detector:** Implement machine learning algorithms to detect failures proactively.
4. **Reward System:** Introduce a reward system to motivate users to submit accurate and helpful reports.

## Weekly Progress Report:

This week has been crucial for our project as it marks the final stage of development. After working on the creation of
the product, we are now focusing on polishing it to perfection. Speaking about the changes:

* **Bot Enhancement:** After taking the first, 'hot' user surveys, we have conducted a major refactoring of the
  user interface. We changed the style of our buttons, creating a more visually appealing and, more importantly, a
  clearer and more concise interface. Based on the user's flow, we are trying to make the use of the application as
  smooth as possible. Check it by yourself, there is the link: [BOT](https://t.me/monidorm_bot)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/Monidorm/bot-interface-sketch.jpg">
</div>

* **Fault Alerting Mechanism:** At the stage of creating a smart algorithm, we have finally reached the 'golden ratio'.
  The service can now use data from users to analyze it using a self-developed mechanism and investigate the possible
  reasons. It can then summarize the overall feedback and notify subscribed users. Simply put, the
  system can now function properly as an isolated one, means without any human intervention. The use of AI has replaced
  the
  need for manual labor.
* **Frontend Website:** The well-designed website is approaching the production stage. We have tested a large number of
  features, such as graphics and an admin panel controller, and we are planning to analyze the feedback we have
  collected in order to make any necessary changes and integrate them properly into our ecosystem. This will help us
  bring our project closer to completion.
* **Backend:** The essential part of the entire system is now brand new. After all the testing activities were
  completed, we can now introduce the fully functional API application with a coverage of nearly **90%**. Additionally,
  the
  backend has now implemented SonarQube code linter, which analyzes code on each pull request submitted to the _dev_
  branch. Due to our careful approach to writing code, there are no issues with this at all.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="/2024/Monidorm/test-coverage.jpg">
</div>

* **Database:** It is hard not to mention another important point: now, DDoS attacks are nearly impossible. Our
  ecosystem will not process reports that are sent twice in a row with identifying meta information within N minutes (a
  configurable parameter). This is all implemented without any changes to the source code, simply by using the
  capabilities of the _PostgreSQL_ database.

### Challenges & Solutions

The challenges of this week are connected with the previous ones because the reason for some is not clear enough. Saying
more concretely:

* **Database Server Time Zones:** There are problems with the timezone of the PostgreSQL database's server. It seems
  that the server has an incorrect timezone, but we need to know more about it to answer the raised questions.
* **Frontend & API Connection:** There are some issues with the IU virtual machines and the web application due to the
  network configuration at our university. For some reason, connections cannot be established to certain endpoints while
  they are working perfectly for others.

### Conclusions & Next Steps

We need to make the system as stable as possible and provide the functionality to our direct users for further
investigation and enhancement iterations after the production release.

* Complete the website development process and integrate it into the ecosystem.
* Add dashboards to Grafana to make it easier for admins to use this analytics tool.
* If possible, create a CI/CD pipeline that will automatically integrate new features into our system without manual
  intervention from developers.
* Write up the necessary documentation for our systems that can provide crucial and, at the same time, brief information
  about technologies.
