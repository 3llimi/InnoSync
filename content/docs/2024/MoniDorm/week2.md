### **Architecture Design**

1. **Component Breakdown**:
    
    **Backend Components**

    - <u>API:</u>

        1. Serve as the primary interface for data interaction between the frontend, Telegram bot, and databases.
        2. Handle requests related to reporting issues, fetching user data, and managing statistics.
        3. Ensure secure and efficient communication between components.

        Interactions:
        Receives and processes data from the Telegram bot and WebApp.
        Communicates with PostgreSQL for report storage and MongoDB for user information.
        Interfaces with the LLM system for comment analysis.
    - <u>PostgreSQL Database for reports:</u>

        1. Store and manage reports related to dormitory infrastructure issues.
        2. Maintain data integrity and support complex queries for report statistics and analysis.
        
        Interactions:
        API communicates with PostgreSQL to store, retrieve, and update report data.
        WebApp queries PostgreSQL for generating statistics and reports.
     - <u>MongoDB Database for bot:</u>

        1. Store and manage user information, including user profiles and interaction history.
        2. Provide a flexible schema for handling diverse user data.
        
        Interactions:
        API communicates with MongoDB to store, retrieve, and update user information.
    - <u>LLM System:</u>

        1. Analyze comments in reports to extract insights and detect patterns.
        2. Assist in categorizing issues and providing additional context for reported problems.
        
        Interactions:
        Receives comments from the API for analysis.
        Sends analysis results back to the API to enhance report data.

    **Frontend Components**

    - <u>Telegram Bot (+ REST Listener):</u>

        1. Provide a user-friendly interface for students to report issues.
        2. Collect data such as the type of failure, location, and user comments.
        3. Send notifications and updates to users about the status of their reports.
        
        Interactions:
        Sends collected report data to the API.
        Receives notifications and updates from the API to send back to users.
    - <u>WebApp for Admins:</u>

        1. Provide a dashboard for administrators to view statistics and manage reports.
        2. Display data visualizations for better understanding of infrastructure issues and user interactions.
        3. Allow admins to update report statuses and communicate with users if necessary.
        
        Interactions:
        Queries the API to fetch report data, user information, and analysis results.
        Displays statistics and insights fetched from PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
