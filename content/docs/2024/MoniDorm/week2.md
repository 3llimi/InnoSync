### **Architecture Design**

1. **Component Breakdown**:
    
    **Backend Components**

    - <u>API:</u>

        1. Serve as the primary interface for data interaction between the frontend, Telegram bot, and databases.
        2. Handle requests related to reporting issues, fetching user data, and managing statistics.
        3. Ensure secure and efficient communication between components.

        Interactions:
        - Receives and processes data from the Telegram bot and WebApp.
        - Communicates with PostgreSQL for report storage.
        - Interfaces with the LLM system for comment analysis.
    - <u>PostgreSQL Database for reports:</u>

        1. Store and manage reports related to dormitory infrastructure issues.
        2. Maintain data integrity and support complex queries for report statistics and analysis.
        
        Interactions:
        - API communicates with PostgreSQL to store, retrieve, and update report data.
        - WebApp queries PostgreSQL for generating statistics and reports.
     - <u>MongoDB Database for bot:</u>

        1. Store and manage user information, including user profiles and interaction history.
        2. Provide a flexible schema for handling diverse user data.
        
        Interactions:
        - Telegram Bot uses MongoDB to store, retrieve, and update user information.
    - <u>LLM System:</u>

        1. Analyze comments in reports to extract insights and detect patterns.
        2. Assist in categorizing issues and providing additional context for reported problems.
        3. Summarize comments in several reports to identify one common problem.
        
        Interactions:
        - Receives comments from the API for analysis.
        - Sends analysis results back to the API to enhance report data.

    **Frontend Components**

    - <u>Telegram Bot (+ REST Listener):</u>

        1. Provide a user-friendly interface for students to report issues.
        2. Collect data such as the type of failure, location, and user comments.
        3. Send notifications and updates to users about the status of their reports.
        4. Perform authorization for security.
        
        Interactions:
        - Sends collected report data to the API.
        - Receives notifications and updates from the API to send back to users.
    - <u>WebApp for Admins:</u>

        1. Provide a dashboard for administrators to view statistics and manage reports.
        2. Display data visualizations for better understanding of infrastructure issues and user interactions.
        3. Allow admins to update report statuses and communicate with users if necessary.
        
        Interactions:
        - Queries the API to fetch report data, user information, and analysis results.
        - Displays statistics and insights fetched from PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

2. **Data Management**:

    Our system has two databases for reports (PostgreSQL) and for user information (MongoDB).

    **PostgreSQL Database (for Reports)**
    
    <u>Why we deciced to choose this database:</u>
    - Relational database structure to handle structured data efficiently.
    - Support for advanced querying and indexing to enhance performance.
    - ACID compliance to guarantee transactional integrity and reliability.

    <u>Purpose:</u>
    1. Store and manage all reports related to dormitory infrastructure issues.
    2. Ensure data integrity, support complex queries, and facilitate efficient data retrieval for reporting and analysis.

    <u>Data Types Stored:</u>

    Report ID, type of failure, location, timestamp, status.
    User comments associated with each report.
    Analysis results from the LLM system.

    **MongoDB Database (for User Information)**

    <u>Why we deciced to choose this database:</u>
    - NoSQL database structure for handling unstructured and semi-structured data.
    - Schema-less design allowing easy updates and scaling.
    - High availability and scalability to accommodate growing data volumes.

    <u>Purpose:</u>
    1. Store and manage user information, including user profiles and interaction history.
    2. Provide a flexible schema to handle diverse and evolving user data requirements.
    
    <u>Data Types Stored:</u>

    User ID, name, contact details, and role (e.g., student, admin).
    Interaction history, including reports submitted and notifications received.

### **Week 2 questionnaire:**

1) **Tech Stack Resources:**

    At present, we do not utilize any project-based books. Instead, we rely extensively on the documentation and resources provided by the frameworks that we are employing.

2) **Mentorship Support:**

    Currently, we do not have a mentor involved in our project, as our idea is in the early stages of development. However, we are considering the option of hiring a mentor in the future to enhance our system and expand its scope beyond the student dormitory level. After implementing the minimum functionality of our project, we plan to seek feedback from the dormitory administration. This feedback will be invaluable, as it will allow us to effectively tailor the project to our target audience and facilitate its adoption by users.
