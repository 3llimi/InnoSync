## Presentation

## Weekly Progress Report:

This week, our team focused on addressing the challenges related to the connection between the front-end and back-end of our UX/UI design, aiming to make it more adaptive. We also finalized the creation of the program, ensuring that all components are well-integrated.

### Challenges & Solutions

1. Front-End and Back-End Connection:
- Issue: There were problems with the connection between the front-end and back-end components, causing inconsistencies in data display and functionality.
- Solution: We identified and rectified the mismatches in API calls and data handling, improving the communication between the front and back ends.
2. Adaptive UX/UI Design:
- Issue: Ensuring the design adapts smoothly across different devices and screen sizes posed a significant challenge.
- Solution: We implement responsive design techniques and conducted thorough testing on various devices to ensure adaptability.
3. Frontend deploy:
- Issue: Disability to deploy to vercel.com since repository with our code doesn’t belong to us
- One of the solution might be exposing svelte port on server’s virtual machine and allow to connect it with backend, which wasn’t implemented yet due to needness of asynchronous connect between backend and frontend



### Conclusions & Next Steps

In conclusion, the back-end functionalities, 
including machine learning models, are operating smoothly and are stable,
while the primary issue with the front-end connection has not been largely resolved, 
leading to stagnation in  synchronization with the back-end. Moving forward, we will continue
to monitor and address any remaining or new issues in the front-end and back-end connection. 
We will also prepare for upcoming presentations by ensuring the entire program functions 
seamlessly and by creating comprehensive presentation materials that highlights.
