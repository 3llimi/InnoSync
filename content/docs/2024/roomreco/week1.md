## Value Proposition

Traditional processes for assigning students to dorm rooms often lead to
mismatched roommates, causing dissatisfaction and conflicts. The lack of
consideration for personal preferences and interests in room assignments results
in a stressful living environment, which can negatively impact students’
academic performance and overall well-being. Additionally, manual assignment
methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive for campus administrators.

We utilize advanced machine learning algorithms and an intuitive web platform to
optimize the allocation of dorm rooms based on students’ preferences and mutual
interests. The system gathers data through questionnaires and processes it to
provide personalized roommate recommendations.

### Benefits to Users

1. _Student_: Enhanced living experience with compatible roommates, leading to a
   more positive social environment and improved academic performance.
2. _Administrator_: Streamlined and automated room assignment process reduces
   administrative burden, saving time and resources.
3. _Institution_: Higher student satisfaction rates contribute to a better
   reputation and increased enrollment rates.

### Differentiation

We stand out by creating machine learning that offers personalized roommate
recommendations. This personalized and data-driven approach significantly
improves the accuracy and satisfaction of room assignments.

### User Impact

Students experience less stress and conflict with their roommates, leading to a
more harmonious living environment. Administrators benefit from a reduced
workload and more efficient room assignment processes. Overall, the institution
enjoys higher student satisfaction and retention rates.

### Use Cases

- **Scenario**: A university’s housing department needs to assign rooms to
  incoming freshmen.

  **Steps:**

  1. Students fill out detailed questionnaires about their preferences and
     interests.
  2. System processes the data using machine learning algorithms.
  3. The system generates personalized roommate recommendations.
  4. Administrators review and finalize assignments.
  5. Students receive their roommate information and begin their university
     experience with compatible roommates.

  **Benefit:** Improved roommate compatibility, reduced administrative workload,
  and higher student satisfaction.

- **Scenario**: A summer camp for teenagers wants to ensure participants have
  compatible cabin mates.

  **Steps:**

  1. Campers fill out questionnaires prior to arrival.
  2. System analyzes the data to match campers with similar interests.
  3. The camp’s administration uses the system to organize cabin assignments.
  4. Campers are informed of their cabin mates before camp starts.
  5. Staff can monitor and adjust assignments as needed during the camp.

  **Benefit:** Enhanced camper experience and easier management for staff.

## Lean Questionnaire

1. **What problem or need does your software project address?**

   The system addresses the inefficiencies and dissatisfaction in traditional
   room assignment processes for dormitories, summer camps, conferences, and
   other shared living environments. It solves the problem of mismatched
   roommates by using data-driven methods to ensure compatibility based on
   preferences and interests, thus improving the overall living experience and
   reducing administrative burdens.

2. **Who are your target users or customers?**

   Our target customers are:

   - University administrators and housing departments
   - Organizers of summer camps and youth programs
   - Conference organizers
   - Managers of corporate training programs and other mass accommodation events

3. **How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?**

   We will validate our assumptions through:

   - Pilot tests in real-world settings, such as universities and summer camps
   - Iterative testing and refining of our algorithms and user interfaces

4. **What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?**

   - User satisfaction: Surveys and feedback from students and administrators
   - Efficiency improvements: Reduction in time and resources spent on room
     assignments
   - Compatibility rates: Decrease in roommate conflict reports
   - Adoption rates: Number of institutions and events adopting the system
   - Retention rates: Continued use of the system by institutions over time

5. **How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?**

   - Continuous feedback loop: Regularly collect and analyze user feedback to
     identify areas for improvement
   - Scrum development: Implement changes and new features in short development
     cycles
   - User testing sessions: Conduct usability testing with real users to
     validate changes
   - Flexibility in features: Be open to adding or modifying features based on
     evolving user needs and feedback
   - Scalability considerations: Ensure the system can adapt to various scales
     and types of institutions or events

## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

We plan to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze student preferences
and interests, providing personalized roommate recommendations. By utilizing
open-source libraries, frameworks and AI, we can accelerate the development
process and ensure the reliability and scalability of our system.

## Defining the Vision for Your Project

### Overview

Our project aims to revolutionize the room assignment process for shared living
environments by leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms to match
individuals based on their preferences and interests. The system will provide
personalized roommate recommendations to enhance the living experience for
students, campers, and participants in various shared accommodation settings.
