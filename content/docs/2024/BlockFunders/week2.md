3. **User Interface (UI) Design**:

   - Designed logo and brand identity with Figma.
   - Created Figma designs and JSON specifications for reusable design elements.

4. **Integration and APIs**:

   - OpenAI API for enhancing user experience with personalized recommendations and automated content.
   - Google Analytics and Hotjar for user behavior analysis.

5. **Scalability and Performance**:

   - Utilizing Vercel for scalable frontend deployment.
   - CI/CD pipelines ensure consistent performance checks and build integrity.

6. **Security and Privacy**:

   - KYC process to verify user identities.
   - Secure handling of user data and transactions through robust backend practices.

7. **Error Handling and Resilience**:

   - Comprehensive testing in CI/CD pipelines.
   - Error monitoring and logging to handle and rectify issues promptly.

8. **Deployment and DevOps**:
   - GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
   - Vercel for deploying frontend, and testnet for deploying smart contracts.
