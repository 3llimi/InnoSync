- Performed manual testing on the frontend to ensure basic functionality.
- Set up testing environments and mock data for continuous testing.

## **Weekly Progress Report**

Our team accomplished the following tasks this week:

- **Frontend**: Finished the landing page, set up routing, and began the campaign creation page.
- **Backend**: Completed user authentication and CRUD operations for campaigns.
- **Prototype Testing**: Started initial testing processes for backend and frontend components.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring seamless integration between different technologies.

  - **Solution**: Held daily stand-up meetings to align team members and address integration issues promptly.

- **Challenge**: Balancing feature development with maintaining a stable build.

  - **Solution**: Prioritized setting up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines early on to streamline deployments and testing.

- **Challenge**: Managing secure data handling, especially for user authentication and KYC.
  - **Solution**: Implemented encryption for sensitive data and robust backend security measures.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

This week, we made significant progress in both backend and frontend development, laying a strong foundation for the Block Funders platform. Moving forward, we will focus on:

- Completing the campaign creation and management pages on the frontend.
- Enhancing backend functionalities, including advanced transaction handling and KYC verification.
- Conducting more thorough testing and debugging to ensure platform stability.
- Refining the user interface based on initial feedback and testing results.

Overall, our team is on track to deliver a functional prototype, with core features implemented and integrated across the platform. We will continue to iterate and improve based on user feedback and ongoing testing.
