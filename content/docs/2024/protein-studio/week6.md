### **Challenges & Solutions**

This week we have faced difficulties with fine-tuning the AI model to achieve better performance metrics. However, the difficulties were solved by thorough work of our Machine Learning developers.

Additionally, this week our team had to containerize our application using Docker. By researching and exploring the topic of containerization, which is an unfamiliar topic for our team, we managed to employ Docker for containerization of our project.
