### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
...

- Solution Description:
...

- Benefits to Users:
...

- Differentiation:
We provide a free website for people who need psychological help. Our service works as a mental first aid kit, not as a long term psychological help. We also never assign diagnosis, we can only give advice to our users. Our service is absolutely free for everyone, so people from different social groups can use it.

- User Impact:
Using our service can help calm down in stressful situations, and as a result users may become less agressive and anxious about their life situations. Also, our website can help people realise their feelings and problems to later discuss them with a certified therapist.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
Our website can be used during anxiety and panic attacks, when a person may need urgent help. It also can be used for some quick advice situations, for example, when someone feels stressed out, sad, lonely or discouraged. Our service can also help analyze oneâ€™s feelings and figure out what they may mean. Our service is not supposed to give diagnosis or help in deep situations such as depression, trauma or other mental illnesses.

## **Lean Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address? 
   
   Our software project addresses the significant challenge faced by introverts and individuals with social anxiety who find it difficult or uncomfortable to talk to a human therapist about their personal problems. Traditional therapy sessions often require verbal communication and face-to-face interactions, which can be overwhelming and stressful for introverts. As a result, these individuals might avoid seeking the help they need, leading to unresolved mental health issues.

2. Who are your target users or customers?

   Our target users are introverts and individuals who require immediate mental health support but are uncomfortable seeking help from human therapists. Our primary customers are the heads of universities and schools, who are responsible for student well-being and are interested in implementing innovative mental health solutions to support their students.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?

   We will validate and test our assumptions by conducting a pre- and post-intervention emotional assessment with a group of test participants. Initially, participants will complete a survey measuring their current emotional state. They will then engage with our AI psychologist for some time. After the interaction, we will administer the same emotional assessment to get any changes in their emotional well-being. Comparing the pre- and post-intervention results will help us determine the effectiveness and impact of our AI psychologist.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?

   ...

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?
