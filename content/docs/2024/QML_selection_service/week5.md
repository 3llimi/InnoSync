## Feedback Collection and Analysis

During Week 5, we intensified our efforts to gather comprehensive feedback from various stakeholders, including end-users, academic advisors, and our internal development team. This feedback was essential for identifying persistent issues, gathering valuable suggestions for future improvements, and ensuring that our project continues to meet user needs and expectations.

### Collection Methods

1. **Surveys**: Detailed online surveys were distributed to users who interacted with our prototype. The surveys included both quantitative and qualitative questions covering usability, performance, scalability, and overall satisfaction.
2. **Interviews**: One-on-one interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. These interviews provided in-depth insights and personalized feedback.
3. **Usability Testing**: Structured usability testing sessions were organized where users performed predefined tasks using our system. We observed these sessions, noting any issues and gathering user reactions to specific features.

### Analysis

The collected feedback was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Feedback was categorized into themes such as usability, performance, scalability, and feature requests. We prioritized the feedback based on its potential impact on the user experience and the feasibility of implementation. This structured analysis enabled us to develop a clear action plan for addressing the most critical issues and integrating valuable suggestions into our development process.

## Roadmap

Informed by the feedback and our analysis, we have developed a detailed roadmap for the next phases of our project. This roadmap outlines key milestones and the steps required to achieve them, ensuring a focused and strategic approach to our development efforts.

1. **Enhanced Data Management**: Implementing advanced data cleaning and validation processes to ensure data integrity and reliability.
2. **Scalability Improvements**: Optimizing the backend architecture to efficiently handle an increasing number of user requests without compromising performance.
3. **User Interface Enhancements**: Refining the UI/UX based on user feedback to enhance the overall user experience and ensure ease of use.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Further enhancing the performance of our quantum-enhanced machine learning models to achieve superior results compared to classical approaches.
5. **Documentation and Reporting**: Preparing comprehensive documentation and detailed reports for users, explaining the benefits and performance of our quantum computing solution.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges

1. **Token Management for D-Wave Access**: Managing tokens for accessing the D-Wave quantum annealer continued to be a challenge, impacting our ability to maintain stable and continuous access.
2. **Data Validation Issues**: Implementing a robust data validation process proved to be more complex than initially anticipated, requiring additional development and testing.

### Solutions

1. **Token Management**: We developed an automated script to handle token management. This script ensures continuous access to the D-Wave quantum annealer by automatically refreshing tokens as needed, reducing manual intervention and improving stability.
2. **Data Validation**: We introduced a multi-step data validation process, which includes initial checks during data upload and more thorough validation before processing. This approach helps ensure data integrity and reduces errors during processing.

### Reflection on Lessons Learned

- **User-Centric Design**: The importance of incorporating user feedback at every stage of development was reinforced, highlighting the need for ongoing usability testing and iteration.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensuring that our backend infrastructure can handle increased load is critical for the success of our project, necessitating robust design and continuous performance testing.
