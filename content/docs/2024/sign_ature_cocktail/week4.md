### Week #4

## Progress Reports

### External Feedback

As a team, we are discussing various ideas regarding the gameplay and design of our game. We will also start collecting feedback from friends who will test our early prototype. Their ideas will be invaluable, as they will point out areas where user interaction can be improved and likely offer various additional features. For example, some of our friends found the hand tracking system impressive. Such reviews will serve as a guide for further steps to improve the product.

### Testing 

At the moment, we do not have a complete prototype, but we will get it very soon when we "assemble" it from separate parts. The greatest attention is now being paid to the stability and accuracy of the hand movement tracking system. We also have several ideas about the location of the game's functionality. As we continue to develop the game, external feedback will help us prioritize fixes and improvements.

### Iteration 

Based on the model we have at the moment, we have started to refine it and create a real prototype. We are making changes to improve the user interface and the performance of the hand movement tracking system. Additionally, the storyline and dialogues of the game are now being refined based on initial user reactions. This iterative process helps us align the project more precisely with our original vision while making the necessary improvements.

### Challenges & Solutions

One of our problems is the relatively short time remaining before the project is completed. At the moment, we have already completed about 70% of the work, but the remaining 30% is no less challenging.

### Conclusions and Next Steps

In the coming week, we will focus on building the first prototype. We aim to improve the user interface, enhance the accuracy of the hand movement tracking system, and refine the storyline, dialogues, and non-player characters. Additionally, as soon as we create a prototype, we plan to start testing it with the involvement of our friends to collect a large amount of diverse feedback.
