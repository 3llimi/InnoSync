## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

In this project our team decided to build everything up from scratch, so we will use open-source Python libraries and MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storing. As for AI, we will consult with chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude models to get more experience in unknown fields faster and resolve confusing errors. We will also contact advanced nutritionists to review the quality of generated menus.

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

- Overview: 

  We want to ease people's lives by solving a serious problem - deciding, what to eat on each day. Main product we are going to provide is a menu consisting of several days and several meals for each day. We are intending to provide the most diverse set of options in the market to satisfy a greater range of customers. Such menus could help people stay fit, manage time for cooking as well as money for spending on products, since our menu will be constructed to optimize product use, minimize time spendings, and count calories. But even with such great surrounding qualities, main goal of our menu is to relief stress of people, providing concrete, high quality, and diverse meal schedule.
