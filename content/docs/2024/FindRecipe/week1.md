## **Lean Questionnaire**

1. What problem or need does your software project address? 
   
   The software project addresses several key problems and needs, such as time-consuming meal planning, calorie management, dietary restrictions and preferences. 
   - **Time-Consuming Meal Planning**: the bot automates the meal planning process, saving users time and effort by providing a ready-made menu for the week.
   - **Calorie Management**: the bot provides meal plans with precise calorie counts, helping users stay within their desired calorie range.
   - **Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: the bot customizes meal plans to accommodate various dietary restrictions and preferences, ensuring all meals are suitable for the user.

2. Who are your target users or customers?
    
    Our target users are individuals who are actively trying to manage their weight, whether they are trying to lose, maintain, or gain weight. This includes Individuals with specific dietary restrictions or preferences such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, or other allergen considerations. Additionally, our platform can be useful for people who have limited time for meal planning and prefer a convenient solution to ensure they eat balanced and nutritious meals.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?

   - Conduct surveys and questionnaires among potential target users to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points related to meal planning and dietary management.
   - Analyze existing meal planning apps and services to identify gaps in the market and areas for improvement.
   - Release the MVP to a small group of beta testers from the target user base to gather initial feedback.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?

   - **Number of Sign-Ups**: Track the total number of users who sign up for the bot.
   - **User Growth Rate**: Measure the rate at which new users are joining over time.
   - **User Retention Rate**: Calculate the percentage of users who continue using the bot over a defined period (e.g., one month, three months).
   - **User Ratings and Reviews**: Collect ratings and reviews from users regarding the quality and suitability of the menus provided.
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?
   - Regularly collect feedback through surveys, user interviews, and observing user interactions to pinpoint areas for enhancement or possible changes.
   - Make adjustments or add new features based on user input, refining the product as needed. 
   - Stay adaptable and willing to implement substantial modifications to the platform if user feedback suggests a different strategy or extra features are necessary.

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

In this project our team decided to build everything up from scratch, so we will use open-source Python libraries and MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storing. As for AI, we will consult with chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude models to get more experience in unknown fields faster and resolve confusing errors. We will also contact advanced nutritionists to review the quality of generated menus.

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

- Overview: 

  We want to ease people's lives by solving a serious problem - deciding, what to eat on each day. Main product we are going to provide is a menu consisting of several days and several meals for each day. We are intending to provide the most diverse set of options in the market to satisfy a greater range of customers. Such menus could help people stay fit, manage time for cooking as well as money for spending on products, since our menu will be constructed to optimize product use, minimize time spendings, and count calories. But even with such great surrounding qualities, main goal of our menu is to relief stress of people, providing concrete, high quality, and diverse meal schedule.
