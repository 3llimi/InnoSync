# **Week #4**

Welcome to Week 4 of the Capstone Project! This week is dedicated to the crucial phases of testing, feedback integration, and continuous iteration. As you embark on iterative development on your projects, it is essential to understand the significance of these processes in ensuring the delivery of a high-quality, functional product that aligns with your original vision.


##External Feedback 
Based on a survey conducted with 10 participants, including our classmates and parents, we have gathered the following statistics regarding the satisfaction and usability of our Telegram bot that creates weekly menus based on user preferences:

### Survey Statistics

**Overall Satisfaction**

- Very Satisfied: 2

- Satisfied: 5

- Neutral: 2

- Unsatisfied: 1
- Very Unsatisfied: 0

Insight: 70% of participants were either very satisfied or satisfied with the overall performance of the bot.

**Preference Accuracy**

- Very Accurate: 1
- Accurate: 5
- Neutral: 3
- Inaccurate: 1
- Very Inaccurate: 0

Insight: 60% of participants found the bot to be accurate or very accurate in matching their preferences.

**Ease of Use**

- Very Easy: 6
- Easy: 4
- Neutral: 0
- Difficult: 0
- Very Difficult: 0

Insight: 100% of participants found the bot to be very easy or easy to use.

**Recipe Variety**

- Excellent: 3
- Good: 6
- Fair: 1
- Poor: 0
- Very Poor: 0

Insight: 90% of participants rated the variety of recipes as good or excellent.

**Recipe Quality**

Excellent: 3
- Good: 4
- Fair: 2
- Poor: 1
- Very Poor: 0

Insight: 70% of participants rated the quality of the recipes as good or excellent.

**Customizability**

- Very Satisfied: 1
- Satisfied: 4
- Neutral: 3
- Unsatisfied: 2
- Very Unsatisfied: 0

Insight: 50% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the customizability options of the bot.

### Suggestions and Improvements
**Enhanced Algorithm Customizability**: Some users expressed dissatisfaction with the current customizability options. To address this, we will focus on making the algorithm more adaptable and responsive to user inputs, allowing for better personalization of the menus.
**Preference Matching**: To increase the percentage of users who find the bot very accurate or accurate in matching preferences, consider implementing more sophisticated algorithms or user feedback loops to fine-tune the preference matching.
**Recipe Quality and Variety**: Although already rated highly, continuous updates and expansions of the recipe database will help maintain and improve the satisfaction levels concerning recipe variety and quality.

### #General Feedback
Participants have provided positive feedback overall, particularly highlighting the bot's ease of use and the variety of recipes. However, there is a clear indication that improvements in customizability and preference accuracy would further enhance user satisfaction.

### Conclusion
The survey indicates that the Telegram bot is well-received by most users, with high marks in ease of use and recipe variety. While overall satisfaction is positive, focusing on improvements in customizability and preference accuracy can drive even higher satisfaction rates. The feedback suggests a strong foundation with opportunities for refinement to better meet user needs and preferences.

## **Testing**
Another important topic of the week - testing, which lies at the core of software development. It allows you to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of your prototype or application. By conducting thorough tests, you gain valuable insights into the user experience, identify areas for improvement, and address any issues or bugs that may have arisen during development. Need to note, that testing is a step that comes after having an already somewhat developed prototype. Prioritize the prototype over the thorough testing on the initial stages. Once you have a product that have all envisioned features, testing will be the next main focal point of your development journey. 

## **Iteration**
The foundation of a successful project's development is constant iteration. This week, we deployed our API and bot, marking a significant step in our progress by managing to deploy our service on university virtual machine. Additionally, we started implementing an algorithm for generation of an optimal menu, which will consider calorie counts and the complexity of the menu. To enhance user experience, we improved the botâ€™s functionality for a more user-friendly interface by improving the connectivity between bot functions and making usage of bot more comfortable. In addition to these significant upgrades, we fixed a few small bugs in the bot's code. These iterations demonstrate our dedication to improving our product in response to suggestions and findings from testing. 
Next week, our focus will be on completing the optimal menu generation algorithm and adding a feature to allow users to mark recipes as favorites. This iterative process guarantees continual improvement and adaptability to user requirements and feedback in addition to assisting in bringing our solution closer to the original concept.

## **Progress reports**  
Throughout this week, we kindly want to remind you the importance of weekly progress reports. Document your learnings, challenges, and achievements. This weeks progress report needs to cover three main topics of the week, namely - 1) External feedback on your project. 2) Testing and narrowing the scope of the project. 3) Iteration and refinement.  

To excel in Week 4, stay motivated, communicate effectively, and embrace the iterative nature of the development process. Foster collaboration and coordination within your team, sharing feedback, ideas, and solutions. Regularly assess your project's scope and refine it to ensure focus and feasibility. By narrowing down the scope, you direct your efforts towards the most crucial features and functionalities, ensuring a streamlined development process.
