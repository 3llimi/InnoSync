# **Week #5**

## **Feedbacks**

- **Feedback collection plan**

This week, our primary objective is to gather comprehensive feedback from stakeholders to refine our product. To achieve this, we have prepared Feedback Collection Tools:

- Develop a structured feedback form using online tools like Google Forms.
- Create an online chart for quantitative assessments of various features.
- Include specific questions focusing on:
>Usability
>Functionality
>Overall satisfaction
>Preferences on calories, cooking time, number of products, and spiciness
>Prepare interview scripts with open-ended questions for deeper insights.


- **Conducted user surveys or feedback sessions**

Throughout the week, we successfully conducted 15 online survey responses collected via our structured feedback form. We sent this form to our student chats. The survey was focused on understanding user experiences, identifying pain points, and collecting suggestions for new features.

- **Documenting Feedback Received**

The feedback collected was documented meticulously, highlighting key insights:

### Usability:

- Users appreciated the intuitive interface but suggested improving the navigation flow.
- Some users found the recipe filtering options limited.

### Functionality:

- Requests for a broader variety of recipes, especially for specific dietary requirements.
- Suggestions to include a feature for tracking consumed meals and nutritional intake.
- Add dishes to favorites: Users want the ability to save and easily access their favorite dishes.
- Product scanning: Users suggested incorporating computer vision to scan ingredients they have at home.

### Overall Satisfaction:

Most users expressed satisfaction with the personalized menu suggestions. However they suggested ideas to improve the bot.


- **Analyzing feedback, identifying and prioritizing issues**

The feedback analysis revealed several common themes and areas for improvement:

We need to prioritize the implementation of the "Add to Favorites" feature, redesign the navigation flow based on user feedback, expand recipe database and improve calorie accuracy.
Continue collecting feedback to ensure ongoing refinement and user satisfaction.

## **Roadmap**:

Having analyzed all the above Feedback it is possible to build such a plan of action:

### In the near future:
* We need to fix the design of the application, the feedback on this item is enough to make sure of the problem.
* Increase the number of filters.

### In the next month:
* We need to expand the database a lot and start partitioning the data into groups.
* Add favorite dishes and products.
* Need to refine the algorithm for new conditions.

### In the next year:
* Need to consider the idea of implementing CV tools
