# **Week #2**

## **Week 2 - Choosing the Tech Stack, Designing the Architecture**

### **Tech Stack Selection**

- **Desktop App:**
  We will use [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) for A-Shot,
  as it is a developer-friendly and efficient tool for creating multiplatform applications.

- **Neural Networks:**
  [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) will be our choice for training and operating neural networks due to its extensive
  toolset.

- **Image Handling:**
  For loading images, we will opt for [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/), as it supports over 100 image formats,
  including those preferred by photographers but not supported by common libraries like [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).
