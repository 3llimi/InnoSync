# **Week #4**

## **External Feedback**

Over the past week, we made a concerted effort to collect valuable feedback from friends and colleagues about our
desktop application. To make the process efficient and respectful of everyone's time, we utilized Google Forms. This
form featured various rating options for different functionalities of our application, allowing users to rate each
feature on a scale of 1-10 and provide additional comments if they chose. You can find the form
[Here](https://forms.gle/M3eoJdfNbbahjobx9)

The feedback we received was incredibly insightful and highlighted several important issues that required prompt
attention. For example, one user noted that "the image preview delays noticeably when navigating between photos." We
addressed this issue after receiving the feedback. Another user mentioned, "... too much space for sidebars or between
folders and groups." Recognizing the significant impact this had on user experience, we prioritized and are going to fix
this issue. Additionally, feedback regarding the UI provided us with crucial insights that led to further enhancements.

In summary, gathering direct feedback from users has proven to be extremely valuable. It brought several key issues to
our attention and provided us with essential insights for future enhancements. We will ask users to test our application
once more to see how the fixes have improved or worsened the opinion of our users in order to create the most
user-friendly application.

## **Testing**

Prior to integrating the machine learning components, we conducted several days of testing to ensure the stability of
the selected model. After this we have started integrating the model into the desktop application and testing it
accordingly.

This thorough testing phase allowed us to identify and resolve issues and bugs in various areas such as database
integration, UI blocking during model loading, and improper image loading. Moreover, it provided us with valuable
insights on how to effectively work with future models that will be incorporated into our application.

Moreover, every contributor of our project had testing session, to find all bugs, new ideas and suggestions in an
organized manner. This approach allowed us to find and fix some errors with the connection of the database with the
application, as well as flaws in the UI

## **Iteration and Refinement**

### **Iterations with UI**

We conducted several iterative cycles to gather feedback and identify flaws in our User Interface. The external feedback
we received was invaluable, providing us with critical insights that greatly informed our improvements. As a result, we
were able to significantly enhance the User Interface, addressing key areas of concern.

This holistic approach has allowed us to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, ultimately enriching the 
user experience.

### **Iterations with models**

Throughout the development process, we faced some difficulties while connecting the model to the application. Despite
these challenges, we successfully integrated model into our product and tested the functionality. As a result, the 
desktop application includes one of the main features, offering the user the capabilities of the model.

## **Weekly Progress Report**

### **User Interface improvement**

As we mentioned before, we spend a lot of time to find and resolve issues in the UX/UI. External feedback also was
really helpful for this stage
Here you can see example of UI improvement, first screenshot old version and second new variant:

As you can see on this example, we removed the large, awkward gaps of the sidebars. The selection box has also 
been converted to numbering with a color selector. Moreover, we have replaced the unnecessary demonstration of 
pictures in the group on the right sidebar with a neat slide bar

### **Database integration**

We have reviewed the process of interaction between the user and the application. Instead of blocking the entire 
interface for the duration of the download, we went the other way, with integrating database to our application.
This might allow us:

- To avoid repeated reimports 
- To update the interface as user import new photos

In addition, the database makes it easier and safer to communicate with data, which simplifies work and allows you 
to quickly and conveniently add functions such as sorting, grouping, etc.

We searched for solutions and chose Room database. We succesfully implemeted skelet database and additional classes with
functions. Still need to connect application with this skeleton, test and fix bugs.

### **Frontend Development**

We continued to develop the frontend of our application, meticulously enhancing it to address various UI issues and
improvements. This ongoing development process allowed us to refine the visual and interactive aspects of the interface,
ensuring a more seamless and engaging user experience. By implementing UI fixes and making strategic adjustments, we
have significantly elevated the overall design and functionality of our applicationâ€™s frontend.

### **Testing**

All team participated in the testing phase of the product. This was useful for different views on certain details of
the product.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- **Challenge 1: Analyze feedback and improve UI**  
  *Problem*: Users and we as contributors were not happy with the interface to a greater extent
  *Solution*: We brainstormed the issues, searched for interesting UI-solutions and make more user-friendly interface

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

- **End Database Integration**: We still need work to end database integration and test it to resolve all issues.
- **End Frontend**: Some things are not included yet, so we need to finalize them to make the product look presentable
- **Beta-testing**: We want to contact more people, to give them access to the beta-test of our product. We will ask
  them to test and analyze functionality of the product and provide feedback. This way may give us more insights and
  help to identify any flaws
- **Multiplatform deploy**: In plans to adaptive the application to the Windows and MacOS to allow users who do not use
  Linux as the main system to use our application without problems 
- **Dark Theme**: As the instrument for the photographers, A-Shot in dark theme might be useful to a lot of people,
  because a dark theme may put less strain on the eyes in the evening or at night than a white one. Moreover, it is much
  more convenient for the human eye to look at photos on a dark background than on a light one. But for now, this feature
  not in the high priority.
