### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:  

  The traditional process of coordinating and overseeing offline team-building activities presents several inefficiencies and challenges. These activities rely on paper tags and manual tracking, which becomes particularly cumbersome when managing games for large groups, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and a lack of up-to-date information about the game's status. This problem creates a significant bottleneck in the organization and management of offline games, especially during events such as University boot camp.

- Solution Description:  

  Our web application transforms the organization and management of offline games by providing a digital platform for efficient coordination. With key features such as game creation, participant tracking, and real-time updates, our platform aims to address the problems related to manual processes and paper waste. By transitioning into the digital realm, our solution streamlines game management while still fostering an interactive and engaging environment for all participants. This emphasis on digital transformation and real-world interaction sets our platform apart from existing alternatives.

- Benefits to Users:  
  - Efficiency and Convenience: The application streamlines the entire process of organizing, tracking, and managing offline games, reducing the hassle of manual organization and making the process more efficient and convenient.
  - Real-time Updates: Users can access real-time updates about the game's progress, keeping everyone involved and enhancing the gaming experience.
  - Customizability: Game organizers can customize game settings according to their needs, allowing for a more personalized and controlled gaming experience.
  - Visibility and Fair Play: Participant tracking and game statistics are visible to all, promoting transparency and fair play.
  - Accessibility: As a web application, it's accessible from various devices with internet access, allowing users to check updates, communicate, or manage games from anywhere.
  - Cost-Saving: Using a web application to manage offline games, we eliminate the need for paper, pens, and other stationery required to run games in the standard way.

- Differentiation:  

  What sets our project apart is its focus on real-world interaction and seamless integration of digital tools to enhance the gaming experience. Unlike existing solutions that may solely focus on digital gaming or lack comprehensive control features, our platform uniquely combines the convenience of digital technology with the fun of physical gameplay, making it the top choice for users looking for an innovative and comprehensive solution for managing offline games.

- User Impact:  

  Our service significantly simplifies the management of traditional team-building games, leading to greater participant engagement, reduced administrative costs, and an overall more enjoyable experience for the organizers and participants. By providing a seamless transition to digital platforms for game coordination, our solution enhances the effectiveness of offline games, fosters a more interactive environment, and promotes fair play and transparency.

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)

Our team plans to use artificial intelligence technologies to improve user experience and optimize processes in the web application. By incorporating artificial intelligence, we aim to offer chat moderation in the Public Chat game, provide a game master for puzzles in Yes/No Puzzles, and implement personalized recommendations for players. The addition of this tool will result in a more personalized and engaging experience for organizers and participants.

### Open-Source  

   We intend to leverage open-source resources like FastAPI, MongoDB, Aiogram, and React to access collaborative tools, frameworks, and libraries. This approach will allow us to tap into existing technologies and community support and promote transparency and flexibility in our development process. By utilizing those technologies, we can accelerate development, ensure security, and maintain a cost-effective approach. Additionally, it enables our team to contribute to the community by possibly giving back improvements or new tools that we may develop during the project.

### Experts in relevant domains

Our team recognizes the importance of collaborating with experts in UX/UI design and event management. By engaging with professionals in these fields in room 319, we aim to gain valuable insights, refine our project strategy, and ensure that our solution aligns with industry best practices. Their expertise will be instrumental in developing an innovative and impactful platform that effectively addresses the needs of our target users.
