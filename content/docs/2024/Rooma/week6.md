## **Weekly Progress Report**:

This week, our team has made significant strides across various areas. To bolster system reliability, we have concentrated on crafting and optimizing unit tests for backend endpoints, a critical aspect in ensuring the resilience and consistency of our application. We have also devoted considerable resources to refining feedback prompt algorithms. These improvements aim to provide more precise and actionable AI-generated summaries of user feedback. These actions aim to deliver a more dependable and streamlined product for our user base.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

We have identified some issues affecting our application's performance and user experience. Due to the small number of participants, the AI model had difficulty effectively summarizing feedback. It tended to reproduce every user comment verbatim and included redundant information, resulting in duplication and clutter. To tackle this issue, we have refined the AI prompts to ensure player feedback is displayed concisely and coherently to game administrators.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

We have finalized the prototype, resolving issues related to AI feedback summarization and gameplay user experience. Our attention will now turn to addressing any minor frontend and backend bugs that may surface and making essential user experience enhancements. At the same time, we will start getting ready for the project presentation, comprehensively testing and refining every aspect of the prototype.
