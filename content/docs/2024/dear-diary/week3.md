# Progress report / Week 3

## Prototype Features:

**iOS and Android:**

- **Emotion Recognition and Management:**
    - **Emotion Description:** Users can describe their feelings in the app.
    - **AI Analysis:** The AI analyzes the user's description to identify the underlying emotion.
    - **Emotion Handling Suggestions:** Based on the identified emotion, the AI provides possible ways to manage and handle it.
    - Future Enhancements - Emotion Analysis Over Time:
        - **Daily/Monthly/Yearly Analysis:** Future updates will include features that analyze and summarize user emotions over specific periods, such as a day, month, or year.
        - **Trend Insights:** Users will gain insights into their emotional trends, helping them understand and manage their emotional well-being more effectively over time.

These features are core to our projectâ€™s goals of providing emotional support and enhancing user well-being through intelligent and personalized interactions.

## Challenges and Solutions:

Our team has faced significant challenges with time management due to attending different electives, scheduling meetings with TAs, team meetings, and finding time to work on project tasks. To mitigate these challenges, we utilize the Meet2Meet service, where each team member can mark their availability, and the algorithm finds overlapping times for scheduling.

## Next Steps:

- **Backend Integration:**
    - Connect the backend infrastructure to enable data storage, retrieval, and management. Implement APIs for seamless communication between the frontend and backend components.
- **iOS Version Development:**
    - Continue developing the iOS version of the application, focusing on achieving feature parity in data storage and interaction capabilities. Ensure compatibility with the latest iOS updates and optimize performance for Apple devices.
- **Android Version Development:**
    - Progress with the development of the Android version, aiming for consistency in features and user experience across platforms. Address platform-specific optimizations and compatibility issues.
- **Logo Design:**
    - Initiate the design process for the project's logo. Collaborate with designers to create a visually appealing and memorable logo that reflects the essence of the application.
- **Feature Development: Emotion-based Feature Flow:**
    - Begin the development of a new feature focusing on emotion-based interactions. Define user flows that integrate emotive responses into user interactions, enhancing engagement and personalization.
