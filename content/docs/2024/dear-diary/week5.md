# Progress report / Week 5

## Weekly tasks

### Schedule Meetings or Interviews

We successfully held meetings with two key stakeholders, gaining valuable insights and feedback directly from them. Additionally, we collected responses from ten individuals through our online survey, providing us with a broader range of perspectives.

### Prepare a Feedback Collection Plan

We surveyed participants after giving them a clear explanation of our project, allowing us to skip introductory questions and directly ask for their feedback on our MVP app version. The specific areas we will focus on are usability, functionality, design and user-experience, performance and overall-satisfaction.

### Conduct User Surveys or Feedback Sessions

Here are the questions and answers:

- [Answers file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LKTFjelrFw0jccaJmqes_2FqONyvF3tUBnH17DMlECM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Analyze Feedback

After reviewing the responses, we have analyzed the feedback and identified the following key points:

- Overall, users are satisfied with the app and its features
- The onboarding process might be slightly too lengthy
- The affirmations section appears clickable, and the font is difficult to read
- There is strong demand for a dark mode
- Users should be able to name their notes
- One user expressed concerns about the trustworthiness of the privacy note

### Prioritize Feedback & Refine the Product Roadmap

Based on the feedback received, we have decided to make the following changes to our app, considering their impact and feasibility of implementation:

- **Onboarding:** We will retain the current onboarding process as there was only one negative review
- **Affirmations Feature:** The affirmations feature will remain unchanged since only one user found it confusing. However, we will change the font from italic to non-italic for better readability
- **Dark Mode:** We will implement a dark mode after the MVP version is released
- **Note Naming:** Users will be able to name their notes by the end of the course
- **Note Covers:** After the MVP, we will add the ability for users to change note covers, which are currently selected randomly
- **Privacy Statement:** We will work on making the privacy statement more trustworthy

## Challenges and solutions

This week's main challenge was maintaining motivation as the initial excitement waned and the end of the semester approached, leaving the team feeling a bit tired. To overcome these difficulties, we used the following strategies:

1. **Break Down Tasks:** Smaller, manageable tasks made progress visible
2. **Peer Support:** Fostered a sense of camaraderie and collective effort
3. **Celebrate Small Wins:** Recognized and celebrated milestones to boost morale
4. **Engage with the Bigger Picture by Revisiting Project Goals:** Reminded everyone of the project's importance
