## **Tech Stack:**

**Backend:** 
Python will be used for backend development. For now the LLM is accessed via API call to Replicateâ€™s serverless infrastructure. This way the development is very easy and fast. Later, we can switch to our own deployed model or a different serverless infrastructure if needed.

**Data Storage (Mobile):** 
- CoreData will be used for local data storage within the iOS application, providing efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of user data on the device. 
- For Android, we will use Room for local data storage, ensuring efficient and reliable management of user data on Android devices.

**Deployment:** We'll utilize TestFlight for beta testing and distributing pre-release versions of our iOS app to external testers, ensuring comprehensive feedback and bug testing before the official release. For Android, we'll employ Google Play's internal testing track for efficient beta testing and validation across devices. This streamlined approach enhances our ability to iterate and refine our applications based on user feedback prior to full deployment.

**Design and Prototyping:** Figma will be utilized for designing and prototyping the user interface, allowing for collaborative design iterations and ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Mobile Development:**
- For iOS mobile development, we'll use Swift programming language and the iOS SDK to create a native mobile application. Swift will enable us to build high-performance, feature-rich applications optimized for iOS devices. We'll also utilize API integration to connect our iOS app with backend services for data retrieval and manipulation.

- For Android mobile development, we'll use Kotlin programming language and Android Studio to create a native mobile application. Kotlin will enable us to build robust, high-performance applications optimized for Android devices. Similar to the iOS app, we'll utilize API integration to connect our Android app with backend services for data retrieval and manipulation.

    - LLM API â€” generates text from prompts

    - Backend â€” provides endpoints for the apps and contains all business logic for processing (but not storing) the data

    - App â€” user applications for 2 mobile operating systems. Store data, send requests to backend. Do not talk to the LLM API directly


2. **Data Management**: We will store userâ€™s data on device to ensure maximum security. This way, userâ€™s private thoughts are only accessible by the user and can be easily deleted. Described in more detail above.

3. **User Interface (UI) Design**: To ensure a positive user experience (UX) and adhere to effective design principles, we meticulously crafted wireframes and mockups. These visual representations allowed us to iterate on the layout and flow of our application, ensuring intuitive navigation and seamless interaction for our users. By prioritizing clarity, simplicity, and user-centric design, we aimed to create an engaging and user-friendly interface that meets the needs and expectations of our target audience.

4. **Integration and APIs**:  During the development we will use free of charge serverless Replicate Instance API. This API will be called from a simple python backend server. 

5. **Scalability and Performance**: 
    - When designing iOS applications, scalability involves anticipating future user growth and ensuring the architecture can handle increased loads and data volumes.  We will utilize CoreData for efficient local data storage, optimizing fetch requests and utilizing background contexts to maintain UI responsiveness and leverage Swift's concurrency features for parallelism and managing concurrent tasks.
    - For Android, scalability means designing with scalability in mind from the outset. Room Persistence Library provides a robust ORM for local data storage, supporting large datasets efficiently. We will employ Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming, enhancing responsiveness by running non-blocking tasks on multiple threads.

6. **Security and Privacy**: All requests to backend server will be encrypted with SSL. Userâ€™s data on device to ensure maximum security. We are also exploring other appropriate security measures.

7. **Error Handling and Resilience**: To maintain reliability, we will develop comprehensive error handling strategies. This includes setting up effective error logging, proactive monitoring, and implementing graceful error recovery mechanisms to minimize disruptions to user experience.

8. **Deployment and DevOps**:  Our deployment approach involves beta testing through TestFlight for iOS and Google Play's internal testing track for Android.

## **Conclusion & Next Steps**

**iOS Development:**
Starting iOS app development, next week focuses on finishing UI layouts and starting Core Data integration. This sets the stage for efficient data management and storage.

**Android Development:**
Beginning Android app development, the goal next week is to finalize UI designs and begin implementing Room Persistence Library. This ensures smooth data handling and enhances app functionality on Android.

**ML & Backend:**
Developed a prototype backend server, testing various serverless providers before opting for Replicate Instance API. Currently, the code runs locally with interaction implemented for LLM (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct). Additionally, Started on a basic system prompt that currently provides mediocre results, which will be refined in future iterations. Next steps involve experimenting with open-source models to find the most suitable one, setting up endpoints with their initial logic, and selecting a server hosting infrastructure.

## **Challenges & Solutions**

A key challenge was managing costs for LLM inference, resolved by using Replicate's free API with a limited rate. Challenges also included setting up a UICollectionView layout and navigating between pages in iOS, along with limited experience in Android development. Solutions focused on studying UICollectionViewLayout and mastering UINavigationController for iOS. Efforts also aimed at learning Android development fundamentals.
