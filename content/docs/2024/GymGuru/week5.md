## **Week 5 - Stakeholders feedback, Completion of the main functionality implementation**


## **Week's focus and importance**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we have prioritized obtaining more comprehensive feedback and improving our process. This is essential because we require independent reviews from external parties to identify potential challenges and plan for the future. To achieve this, we formulated specific queries and created an online survey. Additionally, we continued integrating our initial project ideas that we had not completed last week due to time constraints.



## **Feedback from TA**

## **Stakeholders Feedback**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this week we have conducted a new survey. Our focus group was those, who we have asked during the last week and also we found some new respondents.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about convinience of the interface, most of intwerviewees evaluated it with a high grade, so we can conclude that UX/UI design is user-friendly. We have added recognition for all exercices.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we made some new features, such as fitness test conducting. Because of that, our service became more usefull for users and our survey participants underlined it, in comparisson with the last week this criterian grade became higher. Based on the last week feedback, we have improved the design, unfortunately, some of the interviewees still are not fully satisfied with the design, but the majority considered our site as a good-looking, which is a better result, than in the last week. Furthermore, most of the respondents estimated the idea of the product itself. Also, several survey participants considered a design as not an advantage of our project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We analyzed the feedback from the previous week (since it was a feedback from the IU students who are the stakeholders of GymGuru product) and this week. New feedback was taken using Google Forms. There are several results from the survey of this week:

## **Roadmap for further development and maintaining**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, we are not fully sure, will we continue the development and/or maintaining process of GymGuru process outside of the Capstone Project course. Nevertheless, we defined the roadmap of the future development process:

## **Challenges & Solutions**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we had a number of difficulties:

1. Last week's feedback from the team revealed a problem with recognizing the position of the hands relative to the floor and legs (a person reaches with his fingers, fist or full palm to the floor). !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2. There was also a problem with feedback from an expert in this field (a sports coach), since most coaches are on vacation. Finally, by the end of this week, Yana Bogdanovich (Innopolis sport coach) found the time to test our web application and give professional feedback.


## **Conclusions & Next Steps**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we completed the implementation of the fitness testin, as well as gathering more standardized user feedback. Also, we fixed several bugs and refine some UI aspects, such as logo. For the next week, we defined the following steps and tasks:

1. Continue to analyze and act on users and experts feedback;

2. Test once again all parts of our web application to finalize the working process;

3. Prepare a final presentation of our product.
