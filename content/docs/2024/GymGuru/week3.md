## **Week 3 - Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**


## **Week's focus and importance**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we have been working on turning our idea into a real working prototype, and this is important because it is necessary to create a high-quality prototype, since our further actions will be based on it. To achieve this, we had to complete several intermediate stages and link them together. Our plan was to complete a section with verification of the accuracy of physical exercises, finalize the design of the website, find a platform for deployment, integrate all the parts, connect the database, and run the first prototype tests.


### **Feedback from TA**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our recent meeting with the TA, several important points were discussed:


## **Prototype Features**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current version allows the user to register and authenticate, add his data (height and weight), switch the camera on and do exercises. Our service recognises a user`s body, builds a dot skeleton on it and shows it to the user. Moreover, it recognises if the exercise technique is correct, now only for push-ups.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our project architecture, red elements are not implemented yet. Others are implemented and they are the base of our first prototype:

## **User Interface**



## **Testing (by team members)**



## **Challenges & Solutions**

1) When writing the part of the code related to recognizing the correctness of an exercise, a problem arose: how to evaluate the correctness, and which parts of the body to look at specifically. We were able to solve this problem with the help of additional resources, including YouTube.

2) Our main problem was finding a place to deploy the project. During the last review session, we were recommended the Github platform, but we could not use it due to special registration requirements for a foreign bank card. We resolved this issue by using a rented server instead.

## **Conclusions & Next Steps**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, the team managed to make a working prototype, having previously completed all the intermediate stages, such as recognizing points on the body, recognizing the correctness of the exercise, and embedding the project on a server with a database connection with authorization.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next steps will be:

- To add more supported physical exercises;
