## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

#### AI Chat for Alumni and Students:
- **Event Registration (for Alumni):** Simplified registration for events(Alumni meetings, events for students in Innopolis that they can visit).
- **Get Advice from Alumni (for Students/High School Students):** Students will be able to receive guidance from alumni like:
"When to start a job?", "How to write thesis to successfully complete it on time?", "Was the ... retake difficult??", "What course more suitable ...?" etc.
- **Site Navigation (for All Users):** Easy navigation throughout the platform.

Our team have a strategic plan to leverage the following resources for the development and success of our Alumni project to add AI - chat:

1. **AI (Artificial Intelligence):**
   - AI is an essential resource that we will extensively utilize in our project.
   - We will implement AI-driven chat features to facilitate seamless communication and support between alumni and students (RAG system that will allow to retrieve the appropriate answer from dataset for question written in natural language), and facilitate registration for alumni for actual events in Innopolis and other locations to organize Alumni meetings.
   - AI will also be used to provide personalized recommendations and insights, enhancing the overall user experience on our platform.

2. **Open-Source:**
   - Open-source resources play a significant role in our projectâ€™s development and success.
   - We will utilize open-source text generation LLM model for building our AI - chat.
   - Additionally, we will try to find prepared datasets to train our model to provide advice related to courses, studying, and jobs. In other case, we we will make questionnare for alumni.
