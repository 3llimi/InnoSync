## Introduction and Progress

This week, we focused on integrating the overall project. In previous weeks, we had distributed responsibilities so that each team member was responsible for creating their own page. This week, however, we shifted our attention to merging and combining all of our individual pages into a cohesive project. This process required significant effort and time, as we encountered various challenges typically associated with merging branches on GitHub. These challenges included resolving conflicts, ensuring consistent design and functionality across pages, and debugging integration issues. Despite these difficulties, our collaborative efforts brought us closer to a unified final product. 

We have introduced a new feature to our website: a recommendation system powered by machine learning. This system is designed to tailor its suggestions to the interests of our users, recommending relevant events and activities specifically for graduates.



## Feedbacks

This week we finalized our project structure and integrated all components to ensure a cohesive whole. On Monday, July 8th, we intend to conduct a statistical survey among students and graduates through the IU Alumni Telegram channel. Earlier attempts to conduct a survey were hindered as it did not align with the channel's content plan for that particular week. Our project has now started a second milestone.

Previously we have conducted several surveys as mentioned in previous weeks' reports. However, the statistical survey scheduled for the 6th week's report marks a pivotal step in gathering specific data and insights from the alumni community.
