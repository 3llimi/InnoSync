{{< hint danger >}}
**Important Note**  
We wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the remarkable progress you have made in your projects. It's truly impressive to witness how quickly your projects are coming together. We appreciate your enthusiasm and readiness to tackle the upcoming challenges of the week.

As we approach the final stages of our Capstone journey, it is important to start preparing for the culmination of your hard work â€“ the final presentation. We encourage you to allocate sufficient time in advance to craft a compelling presentation. Take the opportunity to refine your pitch and carefully consider the key points and impactful statements that will showcase your efforts in the best possible light. This is also relevant for the refining of your products - prioritize features and functionalities of highest value for the MVP. 

Remember, the final presentation is an opportunity to demonstrate the depth of your dedication and the outcomes you have achieved throughout this journey. By investing time and effort into preparing a well-structured and engaging presentation, you can effectively convey the value and impact of your projects.

We have now entered **Week 5** of our Capstone project, a pivotal phase where we dedicate our efforts to an essential aspect of product development: continuously gathering feedback and refining our offerings. Building upon the valuable input we received from stakeholders from the last week, our primary objective this week is to expand our network of feedback providers in a systematic and organized manner. Thus, we are entering a second iteration of feedback collection. Remember, feedback - reflection - improvement is a cycle that can get you far. Therefore, think of the ways that you can make most of this process.
