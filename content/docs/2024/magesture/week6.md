# **Week #6**

## **Progress Report**

### **Achievements**

- **Final Dataset Collection**: We completed the collection of our final dataset, ensuring it was comprehensive and diverse to train an effective gesture recognition model.
- **Model Training**: We trained the final version of our gesture recognition model, optimizing it for accuracy and performance.
- **UI and Game Mechanics Finalization**: We finalized the user interface and game mechanics, ensuring a seamless and engaging player experience.
- **Model Integration**: The gesture recognition model was successfully integrated into the game, allowing real-time gesture-based interactions.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- **Data Diversity**: Ensuring our dataset was diverse enough to handle various user inputs was challenging. We addressed this by expanding our data collection scope and including a wider range of gestures and participants.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieving high accuracy for gesture recognition required iterative refinement. We conducted extensive testing and tuning to improve the model's performance.
- **UI Refinements**: Finalizing the UI to ensure it was intuitive and user-friendly took multiple iterations and feedback sessions. We incorporated feedback from our testers to refine the UI design.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

This week, we successfully completed the final dataset collection, trained our gesture recognition model, finalized the UI and game mechanics, and integrated the gesture model into the game.

**Next Steps**:
- Finalize all game assets and prepare for the final presentation and demonstration of our project.
