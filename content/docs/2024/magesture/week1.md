### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
Traditional fighting games rely on conventional controllers, limiting immersion and accessibility. Advanced technologies like kinetic cameras and AR/VR are often too expensive for many gamers.

- Solution Description:
Our game uses hand gestures captured via a standard webcam to control in-game actions, providing an immersive experience without the need for expensive hardware.

- Benefits to Users:
   - Enhanced immersion through physical interaction.
   - Cost-effective, requiring only a webcam.
   - Unique gameplay experience.

- Differentiation:
Real-time hand gesture recognition for game control, offering an affordable and innovative alternative to high-cost gaming setups.

- User Impact:
Increased accessibility and immersion, allowing a broader audience to enjoy a cutting-edge gaming experience.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
   - Gamers appreciate the immersive experience and cost-effectiveness.
   - Users enjoy the novel control method using a standard webcam.

## **Lean Questionnaire**

1. What problem or need does your software project address?  
   It provides immersive and accessible control mechanisms for fighting games using affordable webcam technology.

2. Who are your target users or customers?  
   Gamers seeking innovative experiences who may find advanced gaming hardware unaffordable.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?  
   Through user testing sessions, feedback, and beta testing with diverse users.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
   - User engagement and retention.
   - Gesture recognition accuracy.
   - User satisfaction scores.
   - Affordability and accessibility feedback.

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?  
   By refining the gesture recognition algorithm, improving the UI, and adjusting gameplay features based on feedback.

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Our team will use AI for real-time gesture recognition, utilizing open-source libraries like OpenCV and PyTorch. We will consult with experts in computer vision and game development for refinement.
