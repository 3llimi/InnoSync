# **Week #4**

## **External Feedback**

We began gathering feedback from our peers and fellow students on our initial prototype. The feedback focused on the game's usability, the effectiveness of gesture recognition, and the overall user experience. This feedback is crucial for identifying areas for improvement and ensuring our game meets user expectations.

## **Testing**

We conducted preliminary testing of our prototype to evaluate the game's mechanics, gesture recognition accuracy, and overall performance. This involved testing different gestures, interactions between elementals, and the game's response to various inputs. Our testing revealed several areas for improvement, such as refining gesture detection and enhancing the responsiveness of the game controls.

## **Iteration**

Based on the feedback and testing results, we made several iterations to our prototype. This involved refining the gesture recognition model, improving the user interface for better usability, and adjusting game mechanics to enhance the player experience. We focused on creating a more intuitive and responsive game environment.
