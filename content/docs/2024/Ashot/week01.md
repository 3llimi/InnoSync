### **Value Proposition**

#### Problem Statement

Photographers have a multitude of responsibilities,
from capturing the perfect moment to selecting the best shots (a process called culling) and editing them.
Culling can be an incredibly time-consuming task,
as photographers may take thousands of shots in a day,
especially at high-speed events like sports.

#### Solution Description

Our team is developing a multiplatform tool called A-Shot that harnesses the power of computer vision and machine
learning to expedite and simplify the culling process.
A-Shot can detect blurry or overexposed shots and group similar shots together,
all within an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

#### Benefits to Users

A-Shot offers several benefits to photographers of all skill levels:

- **Efficient Quality Checks:**
  A-Shot's blur and overexposure detection will quickly identify and eliminate low-quality shots,
  saving you time and effort.

- **Simplified Comparisons:**
  The tool's similar shot grouping feature makes it easy to compare and select the best shot
  from a group of similar images.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  A-Shot's intuitive interface simplifies the culling process and makes it less overwhelming,
  even when dealing with thousands of shots.

- **Cost-Effective Solution:**
  A-Shot is a budget-friendly solution for beginners and amateur photographers,
  as it does not require a subscription fee like other culling tools.

#### Differentiation

A-Shot stands out from other culling tools in the market:

- **Subscription-Free:**
  Unlike tools like [Capture One](https://www.captureone.com/en/pricing/capture-one-pro)
  or [Aftershoot](https://account.aftershoot.com/pricing/),
  which can be expensive with subscription fees ranging from $10 to $100 per month,
  A-Shot is a cost-effective solution for all users.

- **All-in-One Solution:**
  Free viewers like [FastRaw Viewer](https://www.fastrawviewer.com/)
  or [FastStone Viewer](https://www.faststone.org/)
  lack the assistance algorithms that make culling faster and easier.
  While they can be used with grouping tools like [PictureEcho](https://www.pictureecho.com/),
  this isn't as convenient as A-Shot's all-in-one solution.

- **Optimized for Culling:**
  Cloud-based solutions like [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) may seem like an option,
  but they have limited free storage,
  and uploading thousands of pictures can be slow.
  Additionally, [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) might be not as convenient for culling as A-Shot.

#### User Impact:

By using A-Shot,
photographers can significantly reduce the time and effort spent on the culling process.
This allows them to focus more on their creative work,
such as capturing stunning moments and perfecting their editing skills.

Also, with A-Shot,
photographers can deliver their best work to clients more quickly,
improving their professional reputation and increasing the potential for repeat business and referrals.

#### Use Cases:

- **Use Case 1:**
  A sports photographer uses A-Shot to quickly cull through thousands of action shots taken during a game.
  A-Shot's blur and overexposure detection helps the photographer eliminate low-quality shots,
  while the similar shot grouping feature allows for easy comparison and selection of the best images.
  The photographer can then quickly edit and submit the images to their client,
  meeting tight deadlines and showcasing their best work

- **Use Case 2:**
  An amateur photographer, passionate about capturing cityscapes and architecture,
  uses A-Shot to improve his/her photography skills and workflow.
  The cost-effective and user-friendly solution helps the photographer cull his/her images,
  learn from the mistakes,
  and identify the strengths.
  With A-Shot,
  the photographer can focus more on honing their craft and exploring new locations,
  rather than being bogged down by the time-consuming culling process.

## **Lean Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean methodology:

1. **What problem or need does your software project address?**

   A-Shot streamlines the photo culling process,
   saving photographers time and effort.

2. **Who are your target users or customers?**

   Target users are photographers of all skill levels,
   particularly those seeking a cost-effective solution.

3. **How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?**

   We will validate and test our assumptions through user interviews, surveys, and an MVP.
   We will gather feedback and iterate the product based on the insights.

4. **What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?**

   We'll measure the success of A-Shot using user acquisition, growth, and satisfaction,
   and time saved in the culling process compared to other methods.

5. **How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?**

   We'll continuously gather and analyze user feedback,
   prioritize and implement changes in an agile and iterative manner,
   and be prepared to pivot our product strategy or business model
   if required to better address the needs of our target users.
