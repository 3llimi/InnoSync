# Week #5 Report

## Project Focus & Approach

### Specific Focus of the Week
This week, our focus was on gathering broader feedback from potential clients, users, and fellow students to refine and enhance the product's usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction. The goal was to establish a robust feedback loop for continuous improvement.

### Importance of the Week’s Work
Gathering and analyzing feedback is crucial for ensuring our Alumni Portal meets user expectations and functions seamlessly. This feedback-driven approach helps in aligning the product with user needs, thus enhancing its value and engagement potential.

### Methods, Tools, and Approaches
- **Feedback Collection Plan**: We created a structured plan with specific questions and focus areas for gathering feedback.
- **Algorithmic Feedback Collection**: Utilized online forms and charts to standardize feedback collection.
- **Interviews and Surveys**: Conducted one-on-one meetings and distributed online surveys to gather detailed input.
- **Documentation and Analysis**: Systematically documented feedback and analyzed it to identify common themes and patterns.
- **Prioritization**: Prioritized feedback based on its impact and feasibility of implementation.

### Justification of Choices
These methods ensured a comprehensive and systematic collection of both qualitative and quantitative feedback. This approach enabled us to effectively identify and prioritize actionable insights, which is essential for refining the product.

## Results & Analysis

### Findings and Outcomes
- **User Feedback**: Collected feedback from 33 users, highlighting various aspects of usability and functionality.
- **Common Themes**: Identified recurring issues such as user interface complexities, navigation difficulties, and the need for better support.
- **Quantitative Data**: Gathered quantitative assessments indicating overall user satisfaction and areas needing improvement.

### Analysis
The feedback underscored the importance of a user-friendly design and highlighted specific areas for improvement:
- **Navigation**: Users found the navigation somewhat confusing and suggested a more intuitive layout.
- **Visual Design**: Feedback indicated the need for a more appealing visual design to enhance user experience.
- **User Support**: Users requested FAQ or some sort of a guide to better understand the portal's features.

### Implications for Overall Project
These findings are crucial for guiding our next steps in development. Addressing the identified issues will significantly improve user satisfaction, engagement, and the overall success of the Alumni Portal.

## Conclusions & Next Steps

### Key Takeaways
- Users appreciate the portal’s potential but identified lack of some essential functions and highlighted areas needing improvement in navigation and design.
- Continuous feedback is essential for iterative development and ensuring the product aligns with user needs.

### Actionable Next Steps
- **Interface Improvements**: Redesign the navigation structure and enhance visual elements.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Implement FAQ, better home page, funding system, co-integration with other university portals.
- **Continuous Feedback**: Maintain an ongoing feedback loop to monitor improvements and gather further insights.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Identified Challenges
- **Scheduling Conflicts**: Difficulties in scheduling interviews with stakeholders.
- **Feedback Variability**: Variability in the depth and quality of feedback received.

### Solutions Implemented
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Offered multiple time slots and online survey options to accommodate stakeholders' schedules.
