# **Week #4**

## **Weekly Progress**

During this week, our team has moved towards a fully-functioning MVP.

### Front-end Development

Our front-end developers have made up several website pages. In particular, main page, register and authorization pages have been implemented.

### Back-end Development
We have added the ability to customize banners. When creating a link, the user can upload a banner through the API and attach it to the link.
Moreover, you can specify additional settings for link, such as redirect limits, views, expiration date, custom link. They will be saved in the database, and will be supported by the API without the need to change the response schemes.

## **External Feedback**

We collected external feedback from a group of fellow students. As the website prototype was not completed yet, part of the feedback was based on our Figma prototype. After analyzing the feedback, the following points were highlited:

### Pros

All users liked the broad functionality for link customization. The UX/UI part of the website was, in general, evaluated as visually pleasing, consistent, intuitive and easy to use. In particular, users appreciated the presence of two color themes.

### Cons

Several minor bugs, like unexpected button behavior, were found and fixed. Some users expressed their frustration with the fact that there is no cross in the corner of LinkLink Pro banner.

## **Iteration**    
This week we plan to finally implement all the functionality and leave only improvements, testing and bug fixes for the next week. We also need to do DevOps stuff and deploy the application on a remote server.
