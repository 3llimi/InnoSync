Meetings with stakeholders 

As our team doesn't have any particular stakeholders, we aimed to contact our fellow students and ask them to try our application via conducting meetings with them. This brought us a lot of useful and sincere feedback. We have also undertaken an online survey to rate our current UI\UX implementation and provide any additional feedback.


Prepare a feedback collection plan
As stated previously, we conducted a one-to-one sessions with potential stakeholders and provided them with the functional prototype. One of the team members presents a main task for the client to accomplish. User interacts with our prototype and tries to achieve the prototype goal, while our team observes and documents any difficulties and notes appeared during his journey. \
In parallel, we discussed the possible questions and areas to focus on for the user surveys. After that, our team created the Google Form hosted online and shared among the focus group. \
To get the detailed feedback, we splitted the survey on the web application sections:
- auth and registration
- link creation
- page redirection
- overall satisfaction
- usability and functionality questions


Document feedback received from stakeholders





Analyze the feedback collected to identify common themes, patterns



Prioritize the feedback based on its impact and feasibility of implementation





For those who are willing to continue their projects after Capstone - discuss and refine the product roadmap




Implement necessary changes or enhancements to the product based on the feedback received, following the projectâ€™s development process.
We implemented the fixes for the frontend application bugs that were discovered during the meetings, and described by the survey feedback. In particular, we fixed the form validation bugs and improved the UX of link creation checkboxes, so it became more intuitive and non-confusing.
