# **Week #5**

Meetings with stakeholders 

As our team doesn't have any particular stakeholders, we aimed to contact our fellow students and ask them to try our application via conducting meetings with them. This brought us a lot of useful and sincere feedback. We have also undertaken an online survey to rate our current UI\UX implementation and provide any additional feedback.


Prepare a feedback collection plan





Conduct user surveys or feedback sessions




Document feedback received from stakeholders





Analyze the feedback collected to identify common themes, patterns



Prioritize the feedback based on its impact and feasibility of implementation





For those who are willing to continue their projects after Capstone - discuss and refine the product roadmap




Implement necessary changes or enhancements to the product based on the feedback received, following the projectâ€™s development process.
