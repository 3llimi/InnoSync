## **Weekly Progress Report**:

The 6th week is the pre-final week of project development. Consequently, we were focused on finalizing everything we need for successful presentation, in particular
- combine all finished parts of the project together
- fix any errors which may occur in the process
- start preparing the presentation


### **Challenges & Solutions**

We faced a problem with cpp linter, since the needed formatting of the code was not obvious. We solved this problem by creating a configuration file to enable the automatic code linting.

We have also encountered issues with the odometry frame in Nav2 Path Planner, since the frame was incorrect. 

We also had miscommunication between our team and Simulation team on the topic of velocity measurement units. However, after discussing the issue again, we were able to fix the problem.


### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

The next week will be the final week of the capstone project. Consequently, we do not plan to add any major changes to the project. The goals for the next week are the following:

1. Finish the presentation and rehearse it, so that during the actual project presentation everything goes as smoothly as possible

2. Fix all bugs and errors connected with Frontend-Backend and Backend-Hardware/Simulation communication
