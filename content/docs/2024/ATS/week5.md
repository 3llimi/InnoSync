# Week 5 (Interim assessment and preparation for presentation)

## Project status & final overview

### Product strategy:

Based on our experiences in developing and validating hypotheses, along with insights from potential users, we recognize the need to refine and refocus our project strategy. Specifically, our exploration into using advanced AI techniques and traditional trading algorithms for predicting cryptocurrency market behavior has highlighted significant challenges at this stage. As we move forward with our open-source scientific educational platform aimed at exploring AI and trade algorithms for market predictions, we will prioritize building a robust foundation of empirical data and insights. This process will involve rigorously testing hypotheses, interpreting results effectively, and rapidly iterating to refine our approach. By leveraging these learnings, we aim to establish a platform that not only educates but also contributes valuable, actionable knowledge to the broader community interested in AI-driven market analysis.

### Product value:

Our primary aim is to share the knowledge and practical insights we've accumulated through weeks of researching, validating, and applying AI and trading algorithms to forecast cryptocurrency prices.

In integrating this principle into our product strategy for the open-source scientific educational platform focused on AI and trade algorithms for market predictions, we prioritize transparency and accessibility. We plan to disseminate the empirical data and practical experiences gathered during our research process. This will involve detailing methodologies, presenting validated models, and offering real-world applications of AI in predicting market trends. By openly sharing our insights and fostering collaborative learning, we aim to empower users with the tools and understanding needed to navigate and leverage AI effectively in financial markets. This approach not only enriches our platform's content but also cultivates a community of informed practitioners and enthusiasts committed to advancing the field of AI-driven market analysis.

### Usage of Knowledge in Product Strategy Development:

In developing our product strategy, these features and benefits will guide us in creating a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. By emphasizing transparency through open-source code, providing actionable insights via interactive dashboards, and supporting the implementation of autonomous trading systems with risk management in mind, we aim to empower both researchers and traders alike. This approach not only enhances accessibility to advanced AI and trading algorithms but also fosters a community of learning and innovation in the field of cryptocurrency market prediction.

## Feedback

In week 5, we conducted a second round of user surveys using the Google forms service to get feedback on our product and adjust our current development strategy. As a result, we gathered 15 feedback responses and had several informal, friendly conversations about our project. Below you can see the statistical results we have obtained.

### Results interpretation:

1. One key finding is that most respondents positively recognize the project's importance and support its further development.
2. Sixty percent believe it is possible to predict market behavior using AI and trade algorithms, indicating that people tend to trust this technology and actively use it for their investment decisions.
3. In both the initial and current surveys, most respondents believe that markets cannot be predicted and behave erratically.
4. The primary educational resources for trading, investing, trading algorithms, and AI financial desicion making systems are YouTube and scientific literature. This information can be used in future marketing strategies to draw attention to our project.
5. The overwhelming majority are interested in this topic primarily for financial reasons. Secondary interests include understanding market structures and predictive tools, followed by a desire to learn something new and improve financial literacy.
6. Finally, the initial non-commercial business model based on donations is unsustainable and necessitates adopting a new capitalization strategy.

### Conclusions:

1. There is a persistent contradiction where people believe that AI and algorithms can predict the market, yet also acknowledge that financial markets are volatile and unpredictable. Given this insight, our product strategy for developing an open-source scientific educational platform should address both perspectives. By exploring AI and trade algorithms for market predictions, we can educate users on the capabilities and limitations of these technologies. This approach will build trust in our platform, providing balanced, research-based content that helps users make informed decisions about leveraging AI for market analysis while understanding the inherent unpredictability of financial markets.
2. The primary platforms for promoting our project will be YouTube and popular science communities. With this in mind, our product strategy for developing an open-source scientific educational platform should focus on leveraging YouTube and popular science communities to reach and engage our audience. By utilizing these channels, we can effectively showcase our exploration of AI and trade algorithms for market predictions, attract a wider audience, and build a community of learners and contributors interested in the intersection of AI and financial markets.
3. We need to consider a new capitalization model since a non-commercial educational platform is not viable in the early stages of our project. Offering private research services for the design, validation, and interpretation of AI and trade algorithms to individuals and companies could sustain the project until it gains credibility and trust from larger audiences and corporations. To incorporate this into our product strategy, we will initially focus on providing specialized private research services, which will generate revenue and support the development of our open-source scientific educational platform. As we build a reputation for delivering high-quality insights into AI and trade algorithms for market predictions, we can gradually transition to a more community-driven, non-commercial model once we have established trust and a solid user base.
