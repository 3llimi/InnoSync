### Challenges & Solutions

Throughout the development of the InnoHassle Search System, our team encountered several significant challenges,
including inaccuracies in search results, design and usability issues, and the need for effective feedback mechanisms.
To address these, we implemented rerankers to enhance search accuracy and refined the visual design to improve both
aesthetics and functionality. Additionally, we integrated dynamic theme support for seamless user experience and added
interactive feedback features such as “like” and “dislike” buttons to systematically gather user opinions. Mobile
platform adaptation was prioritized to ensure seamless usability across different devices. Effective communication
within the team and an agile development approach allowed us to promptly address and resolve issues, ensuring continuous
improvement. By actively incorporating user feedback and focusing on iterative development, we successfully enhanced the
robustness and user-friendliness of the search system, aligning it closely with user needs and expectations.

### Conclusions & Next Steps

Based on the achievements and challenges faced during the development of the InnoHassle Search System, it is evident
that significant progress has been made in enhancing the system's design, functionality, and user experience. Moving
forward, the next steps outlined for the project are as follows:

1. Collecting information through exporting materials from Moodle:

   The process of gathering information by exporting materials from students Moodle accounts will provide valuable data
   insights and content for further system enhancements.

2. Adding Telegram search to the API and the search engine on the website to enrich the user experience by providing
   direct access to relevant Telegram posts.
3. Announcing the first release and collecting feedback about it:

   Collecting feedback from users will be crucial in identifying areas for improvement and aligning future developments
   with user needs and expectations.

These next steps are essential in ensuring the continuous improvement and optimization of the InnoHassle Search System,
maintaining a user-centric approach throughout the development process.
