### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
Finding roommates in universities presents a significant challenge for many students. The difficulties arise from the need of a harmonious environment in which students can live and thrive. Having like-minded friends can be a tremendous source of motivation. In addition to that, managment of day-to-day responsibilities in a group of stangers is a challenging task for many. We seek to offer a solution that would reduce the everyday stress of liviing in a dorm room.

By utilizing a detailed questionnaire and matching algorithms we ensure that students are paired with compatible roommates based on personality traits and lifestyle preferences

   - **Enhanced Academic Performance**: A supportive and peaceful living environment allows students to concentrate better on their studies.
   - **Improved Social Life**: Living with like-minded individuals can lead to lasting friendships and a more enjoyable university experience.

- Differentiation:

       - **Disadvantages:** Only offer housing search, without functionality for finding roommates by criteria and managing shared living.
       - **Advantages of our project:** Integration of housing search with functionality for finding roommates and managing shared living.
     - Home Management Apps (e.g., FlatMate, Splitwise):
       - **Disadvantages:** Focused only on budget and chore management, not on finding roommates.
