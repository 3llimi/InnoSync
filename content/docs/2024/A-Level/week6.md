# **Week #6**

## Overview

This week, our primary focus was on polishing the project to ensure it meets all MVP functionalities and preparing a compelling presentation. Below is a detailed account of our progress and current status.

## Key Accomplishments

### Exam Generation Feature

- **Completion**: We have successfully implemented the exam generation feature. This functionality now generates exam variants with correctly defined extracts (text passages) and accurately refers to these extracts within the generated exams.

### Code Refactoring

- **Technology Transition**: We are in the process of refactoring the codebase, transitioning from React to Next.js. This shift is aimed at improving the performance and maintainability of the project.

### Bug Fixes

- **Content Segments**: We addressed and resolved issues where content segments were interfering with each other, ensuring smoother functionality and improved user experience.

### Model Performance and Integration

- **Inference Timer**: We have evaluated the performance of our models with the following results:
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**: 121,677 samples per second.
  - **PyTorch Model**: 3,729 samples per second.

- **Model Deployment Strategy**: Based on the inference times and accuracy analysis:
  - We will deploy both models in production.
  - A queue system has been implemented to manage model utilization efficiently:
    - **PyTorch Model**: Used when the queue is less congested.
    - **MNB**: Utilized during high-load periods due to its faster inference time, albeit with slightly reduced accuracy.

### Continuous Deployment (CD) and Integration

- **Constant Integration**: We have made significant progress in integrating the Constant platform.
- **CD Implementation**: Current efforts are focused on setting up Continuous Deployment (CD), including rewriting the codebase to Next.js and incorporating KANs (Kernel Attention Networks) for enhanced interpretability.

## Upcoming Tasks

- **Deployment**: Our primary goal for the upcoming week is to finalize the deployment of the project.
- **Presentation**: We will also concentrate on polishing and completing the presentation to effectively communicate the project's features and benefits.

## Conclusion

We have made substantial progress this week, addressing critical issues and enhancing our projectâ€™s functionality and performance. We are on track to deploy the project next week and will continue to refine the presentation to ensure a comprehensive and compelling delivery.
