   - Implementing online charts for quantitative assessments in future iterations, once a larger sample size is achieved.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Expand the feedback network systematically.**
2. **Continue the feedback - reflection - improvement cycle to enhance the product iteratively.**


- **Conducted user surveys or feedback sessions**

**Feedback Collection Activities:**
1. **Video Demonstration:**
   - Presented a comprehensive video showcasing the website's functionality.
   - Ensured users understood the features and potential benefits.

2. **Local Testing:**
   - Provided Docker access for users to test the website locally.
   - Enabled hands-on experience to gather practical feedback.

3. **Meetings:**
   - Conducted online meetings with users to discuss their experiences and gather feedback.
   - Allowed for real-time interactions and immediate clarification of any issues.

4. **Surveys:**
   - Distributed a concise survey to collect structured feedback.
   - Focused on key aspects such as usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction.

**Key Insights:**
- Real-time feedback during meetings provided in-depth insights into user experiences.
- Local testing via Docker allowed users to explore the website's features comprehensively.
- Survey responses supplemented our understanding of user satisfaction and areas for improvement.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Analyze the collected feedback to identify common themes and actionable items.**
2. **Implement necessary improvements based on user input.**
3. **Continue iterative feedback sessions to ensure ongoing enhancement of the product.**


- **Analyzing feedback, identifying and prioritizing issues**

1. **Documentation:**
   - Compiled all feedback from surveys and meetings.
   - Ensured clear identification of areas for improvement or enhancement.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Reviewed feedback to identify common themes and patterns.
   - Highlighted recurring issues and user suggestions.

3. **Prioritization:**
   - Assessed the impact and feasibility of implementing the feedback.
   - Focused on high-impact, low-effort improvements first.

4. **Team Meeting:**
   - Scheduled an internal meeting to discuss feedback findings.
   - Evaluated the potential benefits and drawbacks of proposed features.
   - Made decisions based on resource availability and project timelines.

**Key Insights:**
- Users are generally satisfied with the current functionality of the product, especially marking the topic classification feature and generating the new exam feature, which is especially useful for the A level exam tutors.
- Identified minor enhancements that could improve user experience without significant resource investment. 
- No major new features will be incorporated at this stage due to user satisfaction and resource considerations.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement feasible enhancements as identified during the feedback analysis.
- Continue monitoring user satisfaction and gather additional feedback in future iterations.
- Re-evaluate the need for new features as the project progresses and based on evolving user needs.

## **Roadmap**:

**Current Status:**
- Team undecided on post-Capstone involvement and is currently inclined not to continue with the project.
- No extensive roadmap established yet.

**Potential Future Steps:**
- **Decision Point:** The team will discuss and decide on continuing the project towards the end of the semester.
- **Roadmap Development:** If we proceed, we will create a comprehensive roadmap including short-term and long-term goals based on feedback.

**Conclusion:**
While no immediate roadmap is being created, the team is open to future development. A structured plan will be formulated if the project continues beyond the Capstone phase.


## **Weekly Progress Report**

### Backend
- Continued unit and user testing.
- Completed extract parser development.
- Finalized and tested exam generation feature.
- Implemented constant integration logic.
- Connected new front-end pages to backend functionality.

### Frontend
- Finished converting the Figma prototypes to code for creating, editing, and uploading questions.
- Connected all pages to backend.
- Enhanced code formatting for readability.
- Developing the home page, single question review page, and mobile adaptability.

### Machine Learning
- Conducted model testing to prevent data leakage and ensure accuracy.
- Progressing on the interpretability of model decisions using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network, which requires extensive training time.

This week, we made significant strides in backend, frontend, and machine learning development, aligning our efforts towards a cohesive and efficient product.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

**Challenge:** Significant training time for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs).
- **Solution:** Allocated dedicated resources and optimized training schedules to manage the extensive training period. 

**Challenge:** Identifying the correct logic for CI/CD pipelines.
- **Solution:** Scheduled focused sessions for the coming week to resolve CI/CD pipeline issues and ensure proper implementation.

### **Initial Demo**

Below is the initial demonstration of the functionality of the product. All the pages are working and had been connected to the back-end.
