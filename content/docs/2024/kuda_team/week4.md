# **Week #4**

## **Introduction**

This week, our primary focus has been on testing and incorporating feedback. Independent reviews from third parties are crucial as they help us identify potential issues and plan our next steps effectively. To achieve this, we went through several stages, focusing on gathering detailed feedback from a diverse group of users and integrating our initial project ideas.

## **External Feedback**

First, we invited friends and acquaintances of different ages and backgrounds to a meeting where we showcased our app. We then gave them free time to test it and demonstrate how they would use it. Afterward, we asked questions to gather detailed feedback. This diverse group helped us gain a better understanding of user needs and preferences.

The questions that we asked each of the participants using a questionnaire where they had to rate the satisfaction level from 0 to 5:

- Did you find the navigation easy to understand and use?	
- Did you find the overall appearance of the app pleasing?	
- Are you interested in becoming a beta tester for the app?	
- How does our app compare to your current alternatives?	
- Would you recommend this app to others based on your experience today?

We also asked you to give feedback in a free form about your impressions. The main points we gathered from users were highly encouraging:

- **User Interface:** Users greatly appreciated the user interface, finding it intuitive and easy to navigate. Many mentioned that it felt familiar, which helped them quickly understand how to use the app.
- **Appearance:** The appearance of the app was well-received. Testers enjoyed the visual design, noting that it was pleasing to look at.
- **Beta Testing:** Our testers said that they would like to try our application when we finalize it, and if all our ideas are implemented, they will recommend our application to their friends.
- **Driver Features:** Drivers were particularly appreciative of the chat feature, as it allowed them to communicate with all passengers in a trip without needing to message each person individually.

Their insights were invaluable in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring our app meets the expectations of a wide range of users. Additionally, we continued integrating our initial ideas for the project that we didnâ€™t have time to finish last week, further refining the app based on the feedback received.

## **Testing**
Another important topic of the week was testing. Testing allows us to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of our application. By conducting tests, we gained valuable insights into the user experience based on a group of 7 people, identified areas for improvement, and started addressing issues and bugs that arose during development.

This week we tested our backend, paying special attention to the functions of authorization, profile creation and travel tickets. We have developed unit tests that currently partially cover our functions.

On the frontend, our testing was limited to assessing the user experience from the interface since the functionality of our frontend part is still in the implementation phase. We gathered feedback on the layout, navigation, and overall user interaction, making note of any areas that caused confusion or required improvement. Usability testing sessions were particularly insightful, highlighting how users interacted with the interface and providing us with actionable data to enhance the design.

## **Iteration**
Our team follows a structured iteration process with regular review sessions. When a new version of the design or new features are introduced, our team leader tests them and provides feedback. During these sessions, we discuss the feedback and identify any pain points. If issues are found, we create a plan to address them. If everything is satisfactory, we proceed to the next step of development.

This week, we will continue our work in three main directions: the backend part, the frontend, and the mobile app. This iterative approach ensures we continuously refine and improve our product, making it more robust and user-friendly.

## **Progress reports**  

### Our team made progress this week:

- **Frontend Development:** This week, we focused intensely on our frontend development. We held discussions within our team to streamline processes, divide tasks efficiently, and initiate focused efforts. The goal was to accelerate our frontend development and enhance user interface elements.

- **Backend Development:** Backend development progressed steadily, following our established workflow and milestones.

- **Mobile Application:** Implementation of the mobile application began smoothly and is expected to be completed soon, benefiting from its straightforward requirements.

- **Design:** Due to the emphasis on user experience, significant time was dedicated to refining and enhancing the design aspects of our application.

### Challenges & Solutions:

During the week, we encountered a challenge:

- **Challenge:** Conducting testing was difficult due to delays in frontend development. Waiting for frontend components hindered our ability to conduct through testing across the application.

- **Solution:** To mitigate this challenge, we leveraged the Figma prototype for testing purposes. This allowed us to simulate user interactions and gather valuable feedback even before the frontend components were fully implemented. Additionally, we allocated significant resources to expedite frontend development, ensuring that critical components were completed promptly. This approach allowed us to speed up the development of the project.

### Conclusions & Next Steps:

Moving forward, our focus remains on maintaining a balanced approach across all elements of the project:

- **Next Steps:** For the upcoming week, we aim to maximize productivity across all fronts. This includes continuing to enhance our frontend, progressing steadily with backend development, developing a mobile application, and further refining our design to ensure an optimal user experience. This concerted effort will bring us closer to achieving our project goals effectively and efficiently.
