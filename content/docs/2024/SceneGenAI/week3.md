> YandexCloud? i forgot how is it called. Also is database a special thing

As our team got comfortable with the code of the project, we understood that machine learning models took too long to train on our personal computers. As such, we will be using the YandexCloud computing capabilities to save time and our laptops. The rest of the project doesn't require any special infrastructure, except for possibly opening a website on its own server once its time to present our work.
