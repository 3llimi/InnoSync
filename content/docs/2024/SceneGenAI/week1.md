### **Value Proposition**

- **Identify the Problem**:  
For users of [the Leroy Merlin website](https://leroymerlin.ru/) it is important to visualize products against relevant backgrounds to represent the scale of the products and how they look in a real environment.  
**Current solution**: Leroy Merlin solves this problem by filming in a photo studio. For example, a vase is photographed against the background of the interior, a drill on a table in the workshop, and garden furniture against the background of a garden plot. Such filming is labor-intensive; it is necessary to organize the logistics of goods to the photo studio, and in the case of garden furniture, it is difficult to organize a place for filming in general.  
**Proposed solution**: Generative neural networks can help solve this problem by generating backgrounds that match the product.

- **Solution Description**:  
Using AI to create a service tool that integrates backgrounds into product images on the online shop. This tool will help clients to visualize product sizes in their wanted environment, eliminating the need for extensive photoshoots.

- **Benefits to Users**:   
Users will benefit from a more immersive shopping experience and clear understanding of how products fit into their desired spaces. This also leads to better purchasing decisions and customer satisfaction.

- **Differentiation**:  
Existing softwares for background image generation, such as Photoroom, 24 AI or PicWish, generate acceptable results on general requests. However, this background is usually not related to the product or topic, which is integral to our needs. Additionally, each of these products works in English language, which presents it's own problems. On the positive side, we discovered some convenient features such as the ability to easily redact the original image, which we will consider implementing in the tool.

- **User Impact**:  
Beyond improving user engagement, our software project extends to driving sales through enhanced visualization, and potentially optimizing the e-commerce industry's approach to product representation by reducing resource-intensive photoshoots.

- **User Testimonials or Use Cases**:  
Potential user testimonials might highlight how the tool helped them accurately visualize furniture in their living space, leading to a satisfying purchase and a seamless online shopping experience.
