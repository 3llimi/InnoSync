# **Week #3**

## **Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**

- **Technical Infrastructure**:

- Deployment and testing of the infrastructure.
- Setting up the environment for smooth integration of various components.
- Ensuring the infrastructure is robust and scalable to handle future growth.

- **Backend Development**:

- Development of the backend logic for the Telegram bot.
- Implementation of APIs for various functionalities.
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) setup to automate testing and deployment processes.

- **Frontend Development**:

As such, there is no dedicated frontend development this week since the user interface is managed within the Telegram bot.

- **Data Management**:

- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- Implementation of parsers to handle data extraction and transformation.
- Training machine learning models for product purchase prediction.

- **Prototype Testing**:

- An error occurred during authorization with the provided data.
- Fields in the purchase request editing form were not translated into a readable format.
- The purchase request editing could not be completed – the "finish editing" button was not working.
- The logic for selecting items for forecasting needs improvement – with a large number of items, it will be inconvenient for the user to work.

## **Weekly Progress Report**:

Our team did...
This week, the team was focused on testing, identifying errors, and brainstorming new options. We also considered new ideas and decided to add a favorites list for each user. Now, when the stock level of a favorite item is low, the user will receive a notification in the Telegram bot, indicating the item and its quantity in stock, along with a purchase suggestion. The entire team worked on testing and refining this idea.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

- Fields in the purchase request editing form were not translated into a readable format.
  - Solution: Add translations for all necessary fields.
- The "finish editing" button was not working.
  - Solution: Check the functionality of the button and fix the bug.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

For next week, we plan to:
- Continue testing and fixing identified errors.
- Improve the logic for selecting items for forecasting.
- Implement notifications in the Telegram bot for favorite items.
- Complete the translation of fields in the purchase request editing form.
- Verify and fix the functionality of the "finish editing" button.
