# **Week #4**

**External Feedback**:

- Early prototype was shared among several acquitances of ours for testing and feedback gathering. They were asked to note the shortcomings of the current product. Among the most important of their notes was the notion of lack of hotkeys which are an entrenched practice users expect to be implemented.

**Testing**:

- We implemented unit and MVC tests for the backend part and it helped us find some problematic endpoints that was not working properly or was not working at all.

**Iteration**:

- We incorporated the feature of hotkeys into our project design, while overall sticking to the existing plan and vision.
