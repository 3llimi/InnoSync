# **Week #6**

## **Presentation**:
While creating the main presentation we focused on a common template:
1) Problem statement;
2) Our solution;
3) Abstract pipeline representation;
4) Various versions of the models we used;
5) The final pipeline description;
6) The results;
7) Demo.

## **Weekly Progress Report**:

Our team has wrapped up the final stages of our project. We've successfully connected all the parts - AI pipeline, frontend, backend, and API - into a fully functional prototype. This marks a big step forward in our work on text-to-3D AI applications. So, we set up a "Firebase", deployed the API / models via Docker, and created a new design for our web-application.

### **Challenges & Solutions**

The main challenge of this week was proper communication and understanding of each other's code and contributions. As stated earlier, we connected all parts of our project into one this week. Each of us faced individual difficulties, such as confusing Firebase documentation and 'badly-designed' Figma functionality.

Additionally, our frontend developer, Denis, decided to rewrite our website using a new JavaScript framework. This action took significantly more time to complete the website than we had planned. Instead of finishing all work by Thursday, we only managed to complete it by Saturday.

### **Conclusions & Next Steps**

Now, we are planning to present our prototype and presentation to our Teaching Assistant, Rustam Lukmanov. We will make modifications to the presentation based on the feedback we receive from Rustam.

During the last week, we will focus on enhancing the performance of our web application and optimizing the inference time of our AI pipeline.
