#### Value proposition

**Jurnalik** is a mobile application, an electronic "**newspaper**" that collects and provides the user with the latest news, posts and photos from their social networks, news channels and subscriptions. The main purpose of the project is to solve the problem of **information overload** and inefficient use of users' time in social networks. We strive to provide a convenient and unique resource that allows users to **focus** on each piece of content, **avoid holding back algorithms** and get only the most important information.

Our app provides several benefits. Firstly, it helps users reduce the time they spend on social media by limiting the information they publish and consume. This allows users to be more focused and concentrated on the topics of interest to them. Secondly, the app provides protection from corporate retention algorithms by offering a more independent and objective source of information. Finally, our app offers users a lot of interesting content and news tailored to each user, allowing them to stay up-to-date with the latest news and events of interest.

Users of our app will enjoy several benefits. Firstly, they can manage their time more efficiently, avoiding endless scrolling and information overload in social networks. They will only receive information that is relevant and interesting to them. This contributes to increased productivity and focus in users' daily lives. In addition, users will have access to varied and high-quality content selected specifically for them, allowing them to stay up-to-date with the latest news and events of interest.

Our application differs from competitive solutions in several aspects. Firstly, we offer a unique combination of collected content, combining it from various sources of the user. This creates a more complete and comprehensive picture of what is happening. In addition, we focus on personalisation of content for each user, which creates a unique and optimised user experience. Our app also protects users from retention algorithms, which sets it apart from social media platforms.

Our project is expected to have a positive impact on users and stakeholders. Users will be able to manage their time more efficiently by avoiding endless scrolling and information overload on social media. They will only receive information that is relevant and interesting to them. This contributes to increased productivity and focus in users' daily lives. In addition, users will have access to varied and high-quality content tailored specifically to them, allowing them to stay up-to-date with the latest news and events of interest. Our app also provides an independent and objective source of information

### **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

1. `What problem or need does your software project address?`
    
    Our mobile app solves the problem of information overload and inefficient use of users' time on social media. It provides a resource in the form of an electronic 'newspaper' that aggregates all news, updates, and photos from various sources such as social media, news feeds, and subscriptions. Users now don't have to switch between different platforms to get up-to-date information.
   

2. `Who are your target users or customers?`
    
    Our target users are people who actively use social media, news and information resources but face information overload and distracting algorithms. They can be both ordinary users and professionals who need to keep abreast of the latest developments in their field.
    
{{< hint danger >}}
**Feedback**  
The term "people" is too generic! It's better to specify these individuals into specific personas:

- Students who are following university news
- Unemployed individuals following job advertisements
- Coders keeping up with new trends in programming
.. etc

When knowing your uses, you can target their needs better.
{{< /hint >}}

3. `How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?`
    
    To test and verify our assumptions, we may use different methods, such as surveys and interviews with target users, conducting focus groups, analyzing user behavior in the app, and collecting feedback. We will be able to examine how well the app addresses the problem of information overload and assess user satisfaction with its functionality and usability.

{{< hint danger >}}
**Feedback**  

Again, this is too generic plan. What will your survey cover? what will you ask the users? what are the analysis that you  are going to conduct?
how will you examine the overload? 

- You didn't provide any concrete answer here. 

Your first assumption that you need to validate: **Will users use the?**
to answer it, you need to create an MVP and use metrics/ analytics to see if users actually using it. 
Than you can conduct interviews/ survey to learn more

4. `What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?`
    
    We can use the following metrics to measure the success of our project:
    
    - Number of app downloads and active users.
    - Time spent by users in the app.
    - Level of user engagement: number of posts, photos, news they consume in the app.
    - User feedback and feedback on the app.
    
{{< hint danger >}}
**Feedback**  

Good, but you should take into account other metrics like:
- Net Promoter Score (NPS): This measures customer loyalty and satisfaction by asking users how likely they are to recommend the app to others.
- Retention Rate: This measures the number of users who return to the app after their first visit. High retention rates are often seen as an indicator of an app's value to its users
- Churn Rate: This is the flip side of the retention rate, measuring the number of users who stop using the app over a given period.

5. `How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?`
    
    We plan to actively collect feedback from users through various channels,
    
    such as the in-app feedback feature, email, social media, etc. We will listen and analyse user feedback carefully, and if necessary, we will be ready to make changes and adjust our development strategy and app functionality. This may include adding new features, optimising the user interface or changing content sources to better meet the needs of our users.

too generic plan !!

consider defining how to prioritize feedback, as you might get conflicting opinions.
How will you exactly analysis those feedback? 
Beside you didn't really specify how will you iterate? 
how will you handle bug reports? 
how will handle feature request?

### **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**
Our team plans to use AI technology to develop and train our model to identify and classify news/advertisements. We will use open standards and web libraries to ensure our projects are accessible and affordable. We will also continue to improve our AI algorithms by following the latest developments in the study.

We are aware of the importance of having experts in our team, but we cannot find experts due to time constraints. However, we plan to seek advice and input from experts in the field through University.

How? do you have control over posting in other social media? 

> Secondly, the app provides protection from corporate retention algorithms by offering a more independent and objective source of information. 

but, you also want them to return to your app, right ;). 
I mean it's ok to make people return to the app. but you need to give them good reason and benefits

#### Anticipating Future Problems
Now we've already found some possible problems that we should overcome during development.
1. Services integration
   Purpose of app is to pull news from different sources. API or other integration tools would provide pulling. But some services (like Instagram) have strict rules for registring new apps which would use service info (posts in Instagram). 
2. Comparing posts for clones
   User can read news from different resources, but sometimes aggregators could post equal news but in the different presentation of the text. Purpose of app to reduce time-spending in smartphone, so we should implement method for identifing "clones"
3. Rethinking the Newspaper
   The goal of designers to rethink old "newspaper" to new modern mobile app.
4. An obstacle to the expansion of mind horizons
   By limiting the user, we really allow him to save time, but at the same time the user loses the opportunity to learn about a new source of information. Thus, the problem is to find a balance between limiting and expanding horizons

#### Elaborate Explanations

We divided responsibilities between teammates. There are similar divisions in our team: frontend, backend, ML and devops. There are 1-2 people in each unit. Also we will use agile practices and Notion for developing and communicating.

**Feedback**  

I would give this report 3/5. it's good but most of the answers are too generic, and seems like you write it to finish. not to accomplish.
please give more time to reflect on the questions on the reports. they are here to help you build better products

## Week 2. Architecture and Analysis
This week is still in progress, but our team have intermediate results. So, let's talk about this week.

### Tech Stack Resources
We've divide our team on 4 departments: Copyright (ML), Backend, Frontend and DevOps. And this week we've defined our tech stack. DevOps department has now so much experience, so it would use [book](https://github.com/denctl/devops-handbook). Also we want to find mentor that would help us. Frontend Department would use [The design thinking playbook](https://www.design-thinking-playbook.com/playbook-en?lang=en). The book will help to understand the needs of the consumer, to build personas, to understand the subtleties of UX.

Books could help to expand knowledge in the field with which we work. It is possible to find new approaches to solve different problems.

### Alternative Resources

#### Copyright Department
ML Department has been researching text comparison and text categorising problems for this week. Now we're still in progress, but now we're find articles:

- For Categorisation:
   - [Random Forest. Classification](https://www.ilkogretim-online.org/fulltext/218-1662471582.pdf)
   - [Guide how to write a model](https://www.scaler.com/topics/machine-learning/bbc-news-classification/)
   - [Aryan BBC News Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aryankaul31/aryan-bbc-news-classification)
 - For Comparison:
  - [Case studies how to detect near-duplicate content](https://whites.agency/blog/how-to-use-machine-learning-to-automate-near-duplicate-content-detection/)

#### DevOps Department
We've find interesting [course](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) that could help us to define CI/CD for our project.

#### Frontend Department
Except book, stack of Frontend is conclude Flutter, so, department would use some additional resources like: 
- [PubDev](https://pub.dev)
- [YouTube Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAxNZYX7mHM&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ&index=20)

#### Backend Department
Backend department has been researching APIs of VK, Telegram and Instagram*. So, now we're researching:
 - [VK](https://dev.vk.com/api)
 - [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api) and [telethon](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/)
 - [Instagram* Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api) (need VPN in Russia)

### Mentorship Support
We're finding mentors for most departments. We believe that mentors would direct our workflow in right direction and would help us during the development. Frontend department found Flutter mentor [Gleg Osotov](https://t.me/glebosotov) who develop Flutter mobile apps for 4 years. Also, we've finding DevOps mentor, but unfortunately we are still in progress of finding.

### Identifying Knowledge Gaps
Whole week we were discussing solutions and possible problems of development our app. We've understand that our current knowledge could not cover all the requirements for a complete application development. But also we've enough knowledge to define directions that we need to learn. That's not problem, that another task (auf). 

Copyright Department need to find way to train model for classification and comparison. Developers knows classification and comparison, but NLP is new sphere for them. On this week we've already found solutions. Now department is testing them. 

DevOps Department is at the beginning of learning DevOps practices. We're hope that this project could help learning k8s, docker and monitor tools deeply.

Frontend Department already knew much, but it   

Backend Department have mush knowledge about Backend practises. But we would actively practise gRPC for container communication, so we need to research some info for that. 
### Engaging with the Tech Community
Now we're finding new some experts, sharing our idea with community and collecting feedback. Unfortunately, we've not engage experts into critical tech stack problems. But we're planning to do so.
### Learning Objectives
All objectives for each Department are written in the section before last.
We're all open to get new experience in development such app. We would use books, articles, courses and mentors for achieving our goals. 

### Sharing Knowledge with Peers
We have two meeting per week (Wednesday and Sunday). All departments meet together, drink tea and discussing problems. In spite of different spheres of departments, we're offering ideas and solutions for possible problems for all departments. Also, we can share and ask question to developer from another group. Also we've Telegram Chat with topics for each Department. 
### Leveraging AI during Development
On this step, all departments do not have need to use AI for boosting our knowledge. But we could use some AI tools for construct learning plan or generating some textures for design. 

### Tech Stack and Team Allocation
Most departments conclude two developers except DevOps.
