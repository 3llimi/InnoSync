### Value Proposition

- Identify the Problem:
  
The lack of a centralized resource for travelers in Russia leads to inconvenience and higher costs when using the services of private travel agencies.

- Solution Description:
  
The web application will allow users to plan trips and select attractions according to location or recommendations. It allows users to make a route plan, find an attraction by recommendations or search, and save all routes in a personal account.

- Benefits to Users:
  
Advantages for users in using our web application:
  1. No intermediaries: This allows users to save time and avoid additional fees.
  2. Personalized recommendations: The built-in artificial intelligence in our app suggests places and attractions that match the user's given parameters.
  3. Place search: user-friendly interface that allows you to select a place by name or location.
  4. Personal account: That provides the ability to add favourite places and plan routes of the trip.
   
- Differentiation:
  
The main difference between our project and popular analogues is the ability to save selected places in a private account, view and save ready-made routes, and a recommendation system based on artificial intelligence.

- User Impact:
  
The implementation of our application could have the following positive impacts on users, society, and the tourism industry in Russia:
  1. Increased accessibility: Our solution allows users to search and choose places without intermediaries
  2. Development of tourism in Russia: Travelers can increase the demand for local tourist facilities and services, because they will have an opportunity to plan and find interesting places to visit on their own
  3. Enhancing the travel experience: Our solution will help users to find sights and plan trips easily. Therefore, a greater number of tourists will be interested and plan their trip.
   
- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
  
There some use cases of our potential users:

Sasha wants to go to Kimchatka with friends this summer and has already started planning the trip. she doesn't want to miss any of the must-see attractions. so she uses the app to create a personalized itinerary based on her favorite activities and recommendations, and can save her itinerary to her personal account for easy access during her trip.

Ayaz has a few hours of free time to explore a new city where he comes for a business conference. He uses a web app to quickly find nearby attractions based on his interests and lifestyle. he can also save the selected attractions in his personal account and share his impressions of the places already visited.

Karina is a voyager/blogger who is continuously searching for intriguing locales to visit and afterward 
share with her adherents. She advantages from the web app to discover secret and lesser-known attractions in the towns she visits which are put away in her own account for utilization on her blog.

Are you sure about the Differentiation? Because I know that in Google map you can save places privately. about the recommendation system I’m not sure but have you done market research? Did you check Trip advisor? 

Very good using the person but, you really should add what uniques things you can add to the marked.

### Lean Startup Questionnaire

1. What problem or need does your software project address?
2. Who are your target users or customers?
3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?
4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?

#### Answers:
1. It is hard to organize your vacation journey by yourself. It takes much time and responsibility and the fault cost is high. Analyzing yours and your friends interests and previous trips we can offer the best ways to spend your time on your vacation.
2. People in age between 20 and 35 who are interested and have financial opportunity to see the world. So mostly those people are from the middle and higher social classes.
3. Firstly we should provide market research, test our product with a group of potential users, and we can use lean startup methodology to build our startup in the future.
4. We will use DAU, MAU, Retention, NPS, CAC and LTV (in the best case) to measure the success of our product. Those metrics will help us to find out if users want to use our product regularly and they need this product.
5. We will use the Build-Measure-Learn model, building small MVPs and prototypes we can measure if our product is useful for people and we can sell it in the future. In case we realized that our product is useless and people don’t want to use it, we would pivot and change our plans.

### Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

- AI (Artificial Intelligence): We will use AI for creating recommendations of sights and places for users.
- Open-Source: We do not plan to use Open-Source sources at this time.
- Experts in relevant domains: At the moment we do not have any experts involved.

### Inviting Other Students

Are you open to inviting other students to join your project? If so, it's great to foster collaboration and expand your team. Feel free to discuss the project with your peers and encourage them to join if they are interested and motivated.

When considering inviting other students, you can think about the roles you are looking for and any specific requirements. Be open to diverse skills and expertise that can contribute to the success of your project. Collaboration and teamwork can lead to innovative solutions and a richer learning experience.

Remember, talking to other students and finding potential team members to join your project is not only allowed but also encouraged. Embrace the opportunity to collaborate and create a strong team that can achieve great results together.

The problem stated is weak. I love planning my Trip like a lot of people do. Beside how will you analyse my past trips. I will not tell you details.

Users are too generic, “people” is not a targeted uses. Beside why 20-35? How did you can up with those numbers?

Very good metrics and planing

### Defining the Vision for Your Project

- Overview:

Our web application will help travelers plan and organize their trips in Russia. Therefore,  the main goal of our project is to allow users to find interesting sights, create routes and save them in their personal account.

- Schematic Drawings: There are schematics drawings of the future functional with short description.
After authorization, the user can search places by name or use filters with AI. The main points of the AI logic at the moment are being discussed and will be provided together with the full design. Next, the user can see the search results, add places to favorites and save the object to the chosen trip.

- Tech Stack:

We will announce it on the second week of capstone project course

- Anticipating Future Problems:

1. During the development stages, our team may face a lack of experience with the software, as this application requires deep knowledge in backend development and advanced ML skills.
2. Limited resources: Also, we can face a lack of time, because there is only seven weeks to develop a project. Next, financial resources may be required for further development.

These problems can be solved with proper planning of tasks and time. Also, our team should have good soft skills to achieve the result. To solve financial problems, there are many Russian contests and grants to support innovative ideas, student projects, and so on

- Elaborate Explanations:
  
The application is built with a number of important components that work together to provide users with a comprehensive trip planning experience. 
These include:
  - Frontend subsystem: The web application with UI that allows users to see their profiles and recommendations. This subsystem will be connected with the backend part to provide full service functionality.
  - Backend subsystem: The application that communicates with the frontend UI and stores all user and application data.
  - ML/AI subsystem: The service (part of the backend or independent one) which uses ML to build and recommend comprehensive routes to our users. It will communicate with the Backend subsystem to get users data and give new routes.

  In general very good report, I liked that you have wireframe though and you gave thoughts how to create the product. 
  I believe you MUST do a market research to shape your product even better
  5/5
