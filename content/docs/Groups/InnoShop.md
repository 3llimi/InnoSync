Lastly, it provides an opportunity for students to create a profile and get hired as experts on specific projects, enabling them to earn money and gain real industrial experience while studying.

2. Who are your target users or customers?  
The target users or customers of the website are the students of Innopolis University and the University staff itself. This includes both undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled at the university and seek to purchase university merchandise, avail special services, and participate in project opportunities. Also, the researchers who needs to hire undergrads for not-so-expensive fees which also allows the students to get hands-on experience.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?  
To validate and test assumptions about the project, several strategies can be employed. Conducting user surveys and interviews can help gather feedback on the existing problems and needs of the students. Prototype testing can be done to evaluate the usability and functionality of the website. Additionally, collaborating with a small group of pilot users and collecting their feedback during the initial stages of the project can provide valuable insights and help validate assumptions.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?  
The success of the project can be measured using various metrics. Some potential metrics include:
a. Number of active users: Tracking the number of students who create profiles on the website, make purchases, or participate in projects.
b. Conversion rates: Monitoring the percentage of website visitors who become customers by making purchases or availing special services.
c. User satisfaction: Conducting surveys or collecting ratings and reviews to gauge user satisfaction levels.
Repeat customers: Measuring the number of customers who make multiple purchases or use the platform for project collaborations repeatedly.

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?  
User feedback is crucial for the growth and improvement of the startup. Regularly collecting feedback from users through surveys, interviews, and feedback forms will provide insights into areas that require iteration or potential pivots. This feedback can help identify user pain points, usability issues, or additional features that can enhance the overall experience. The startup can prioritize and analyze the feedback, categorize it into actionable items, and implement necessary changes accordingly. Iterations can be done in an agile manner, releasing new features or updates based on user feedback, and closely monitoring their impact on user engagement and satisfaction. If significant user feedback suggests a need for a substantial change in the business model or direction, the startup can consider pivoting and adjusting its strategy accordingly.


## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

The development team can leverage various resources to enhance the development and success of the above project. Here's how they can utilize AI, open source, and domain experts:

## 2. Data Management
The selection of an appropriate database or data storage solution for an e-commerce website catering to Innopolis University would be determined by the project's unique requirements. In this instance, it is being contemplated to implement MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database suitable for handling flexible and unstructured data. NoSQL databases are particularly advantageous in situations where the data model is subject to change, and fast read/write operations are essential. They offer significant benefits for managing product reviews, ratings, and user-generated content.

Regarding storing and managing images, documents, or other media files related to products or user profiles, it is recommended to adopt a dedicated file storage solution such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a self-hosted alternative. Such services provide scalable and reliable storage to manage file uploads and downloads.

## 3. UI Design
The UI design, which we created in Figma, currently contains the basic design outlet of how the improved innostore look like. We asked an university student to help us with the Figma design and how to create a working prototype. He is the first year student named **Khush Pradipbhai Patel**.  
The Working prototype is available at: https://www.figma.com/proto/bFgXwmxt28EWI4U56yuBeN/innoshop?type=design&node-id=57-3471&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=1%3A4&starting-point-node-id=8%3A32  
The UI design is available at: https://www.figma.com/proto/bFgXwmxt28EWI4U56yuBeN/innoshop?type=design&node-id=8-32&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=1%3A4&starting-point-node-id=8%3A32


## 4. Integration and APIs
In the process of developing the e-commerce website for Innopolis University, the incorporation of various external systems, services, or APIs may be advantageous in augmenting functionality and enhancing user experience, like:
 - Payment Gateway Integration: Integrating with the popular payment gateway which is Stripe would allow users to make secure online payments using various methods like credit cards, digital wallets, or bank transfers. (At first, we will use innopoints).
 - Authentication and Single-sign on (SSO) services: Leveraging authentication services like JWT, OAuth or OpenID Connect can streamline user registration and login processes by allowing users to authenticate using their existing accounts from platforms like Google and Facebook.
 - Email services: We will be using Node mailer and integration with email service providers Send Grid, for email services that go along with the tech stack in the backend which is node js.


## 5. Scalability and Performance
When designing the architecture for the e-commerce website using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it's important to consider future growth and scalability aspects. Here are some considerations for a scalable architecture:
 - Load Balancing: We will use Nginx, a popular web server that can also act as a reverse proxy and load balancer, distributing incoming requests across multiple backend servers.
 - Horizontal Scaling: We will use Docker for containerization of the application which will allow us to package applications and their dependencies into containers for easy deployment and scaling.

## 6. Security and Privacy
To ensure the security and privacy of user data in our website, we will consider the following key measures:
 - Authentication and Authorization: Implement strong authentication methods and role-based access control to verify user identities and control their access to resources.
 - Payment Security: Utilize secure payment gateways, adhere to PCI DSS compliance, and avoid storing sensitive payment data.
 - Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive information at rest and during transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
 - Secure Coding: Follow secure coding practices, regularly update dependencies, and validate user inputs to prevent common web application attacks.
 - Privacy Compliance: Comply with privacy regulations, obtain user consent, and provide mechanisms for users to manage their personal data.  

By incorporating these measures, we can protect user data, mitigate vulnerabilities, and uphold the security and privacy of our website.

## 7. Error handling and Resillience
Maintaining a robust error handling strategy is imperative to ensure the dependability and resilience of Innopolis University's e-commerce website. To accomplish this, the system must have a centralized error logging and monitoring mechanism to track and manage mistakes across the application. The use of graceful error recovery techniques such as the circuit breaker pattern for failed external services and retrying of failed operations is necessary to keep the site running smoothly. In addition, informative error messages and logging relevant facts must be employed to effectively catch and handle exceptions. Consistent error response formats must be enforced with appropriate HTTP status codes and informative messages to ensure a proper response to errors. To provide reliable error handling and recovery, comprehensive testing, including fault injection scenarios, must be conducted. Finally, logs must be examined frequently to identify underlying issues and refine error handling practices, thus ensuring continuous improvement of the error handling strategy.

## 8. Deployment and DevOps
To align with the tech stack of Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, a deployment process and DevOps practices can be implemented. This may include:
 - Version Control: Utilize Git for source code management and maintain a repository for collaboration and version control.
 - Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines using tool like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
 - Automated Testing: Incorporate automated testing practices, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure application reliability and prevent regressions during the deployment process.  



## Week 2 Questionnaire:

### **Tech Stack Resources**

**Frontend**: Learning REACT by Orielly is a really good and comprehensive book for REACT. We came to know about the fundamentals of react along with some cool tricks in javascript.

**Backend**: Beginning Node.js, Express & MongoDB Development by Greg Lim is a great introduction for Nodejs and Express. We are also planning to learn advanced Node applications using "Mastering Node.js" by Sandro Pasquali.

### **Mentorship Support**

We have reached out to potential mentors for our project and are currently waiting for their approval. Having an experienced mentor can positively influence our project by providing guidance, expertise, and skill development. They can help us make informed decisions, navigate challenges, and optimize our project implementation. Mentors also offer networking opportunities, accountability, motivation, and problem-solving expertise. We understand the importance of mentorship and eagerly await their approval to contribute to the success of our project.

Thanks to our great mentor: Abdel Rehman for guiding us through the whole procedure of how we can implement an ecommerce website with a great ease.

### **Exploring alternative resources**

A list of alternative resources we have explored to expand our understanding of our tech stack:

- Frontend web-development Course offered by the University (Tech Elective)

By utilizing these resources, we aim to enhance our knowledge and skills in frontend and backend development, as well as gain proficiency in React. This diverse approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of our tech stack and enables us to build a robust e-commerce website for Innopolis University.

### **Identifying Knowledge Gaps**

Before the end of the week, we were struggling with the basic fundamentals of full-stack web development, but after going through all the resources above, we were able to form a basic understanding of where to start. In the frontend department of our project, we knew basic REACT and JS before, but now we are focusing on learning advanced concepts such as state management, client-side rendering, etc. In the backend part, we were struggling with the advanced API concepts such as filtering, limiting, sorting, etc. using Node.js and Express. To solve these technological gaps, we are planning to do more research on the particular stack that we have assigned to each member and practice with the stack using the above resources to get a sound understanding of them.

### **Engaging with the tech community**

We found various online communities that we focused on learning and discussing what we aim to excel at. They helped us in getting a strong head start on our project and filling in some of the knowledge gaps that we faced while constructing the framework of our project. We got insights on the errors that you cannot find solutions to in books or online courses. These communities were: University of Helsinkiâ€™s community for the FullStackCourse, Youtuber Harkirat Singhâ€™s Full Stack Web development community, Stack Overflow, and Reddit.

### **Learning Objectives**

- Learn how to implement a fully-functional scalable API and how to deploy it online: Our objective is to understand how to implement an API into our project to improve its functionality by using advanced concepts such as load balancing, horizontal scaling, etc. We plan to achieve this by reading documentation, watching tutorials, and working on coding exercises related to API integration and Functions.



- Increase our knowledge of React components: Our team wants to have a deeper understanding of React components and how they can be utilized in our project. To achieve this objective, we plan to practice building different types of components, reading documentation, and watching tutorials.

### **Sharing Knowledge with Peers**

We are communicating on a daily basis on social media, having meetings in the university discussing the ideas of the project, changes we need to make, removing additional parts that are not necessary, knowing each otherâ€™s strengths and weaknesses that we can utilize in constructing the website faster. All our team members are providing great insights and are aspiring full-stack developers having some knowledge in the field, which makes it easy to collaborate and learn stuff that the other members lack expertise in. Like the front-end team also has some expertise in the backend, therefore mentoring the backend team in getting a clearer image of the project and vice-versa.

### **AI leverage**

In the modern world, the use of AI can make many aspects of life easier, so we use some AI tools in our work on the project.

- Chatbots: we have utilized AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, to quickly access information related to tech stack whenever we get stuck in a particular concept. These chatbots help us define a clearer perspective related to tech stack so that we can understand the topic better.

- Grammar tools: AI-related applications for grammar and academic style of writing, for example, QuillBot AI and Grammarly, can be used for clear and accurate reports.

### **TECH STACK AND TEAM ALLOCATION**

**Improvement section**
Good, for the money you need to talk to the university how will you handle transactions.

**1. Component Breakdown**

Good division, But I would say that you have to make the product listing the main one.
You donâ€™t really need a home page. Look how Ozone is doing it.

Very good in the other categories, I like the fact that youâ€™ve added analytics. But which Analytic platform you will use? Mixpanle is good option if you donâ€™t know.

One important thing, try to prioritize the feature in the app, and start implementing the important one like product listing and checkout and deli order history or add to favourite.


**2. Data Management**

Good!

**3. UI Design**

I love the design, and very nice image generation usage. But try to avoid using gradient colors, they donâ€™t really go well with Apps a cording to Google Material design. Go with solid colors

**4. Integration and APIs**

Good.
You are in Russia try to incorporate Russian pay gateway. Maybe string doesnâ€™t work here.

**5. Scalability and Performance**
Good.

**6. Security and Privacy**
Good

**7. Error handling and Resillience**

# Weekly Task 4

The task for week 4 of the Capstone Project.

## Improvements upon the feedback provided on Week 2 Tasks:
We will also try to improve on what you suggest every week so we will able to deliver a more better product. Here are our plans on how we will improve this week:

 - **Prototype features**: Understandable that's why this week we have introduced features such as user authentication and search functionality.
 - **Challenges and Solutions**: Understandable. As mentioned, we faced problem in designing the UI experience as it is a tedious task. We are continuosuly improving the UI based on the feedback we are receiving. We are also facing the integration problems while different components of frontends as they are developed by different people.

## External Feedback:

We have applied User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to our MVP. We asked a group of friends and our mentor to test it and give us feedback. The feedbacks were very helpful.  
First feedback, there were some initialized items in the cart. We fixed it.  
Second feedback, the layout is weird on mobile phones. So, we made it reponsive to sizes and that fixed the layout.  
Third feedback, it was a real UX feedback, that when the quantity of an item reaches 0, it gets removed automatically and if it was by mistake, the person has to go to the store again to add it. So, we are fixing it by alerting the user before deleting the item.  
Fourth and fifth feedbacks were positive.  

## Testing

We have been testing the backend part of the application using the respective libraries. After the frontend is completed we are aiming to test the prototype features (We will be testing the features that we implemented this week). We plan to use the respective libraries for both ends.

## Iteration

During this week's evaluation, we found problem in the idea of integrating innopoint system with the application. So in our MVP we are planning to keep the real currency in our system rather than innopoints. Also, we are planning on introdcuing features such as email integrations. This will help the users to keep a track of their orders and earlier transactions.

Upon receving the feedback from last weeks, we have made many changes which includes: prioritising prototype features, removing the HomePage from the web application etc. Also while asking other users, we came to know the importance of font size in the website. Feedback included that the size of font on the website should be big enough as it would be read for ease by avergae user.

On testing the application's ends, we came to know about security breaches that we improved using good coding practices, and advanced security measures such as user authentication.

Good plan but keep in mind:

An iteration plan is essentially the plan for an upcoming iteration. It would typically outline:
* The goals and objectives for the iteration: what the team aims to achieve.
* The features to be developed.
* The tasks needed to develop these features. This might include coding, testing, design tasks, etc.
* Any assumptions or dependencies.
* A timeline for the iteration.


**Overall**<br>
The report is ok. your report doesnâ€™t reflect your work. I Think you should spent more time reflecting / writing the report.
Especially the testing part. it seems you didn't do any testing

# Weekly Task 5

The task for week 5 of the Capstone Project.

## Improvements upon the feedback provided on Week 4 Tasks:
We will also try to improve on what you suggest every week so we will able to deliver a more better product. Here are our plans on how we will improve this week:

 - **External Feedback**: We did the feedbacks personally on our computers, as we have not published the site anywhere right now. So for this time, we created a google form and send it to the same people that revied at the first place. We have included them here.
 - **Testing**: We understand how not providing enough evidence is not enough but tests have been indeed written and using the supertests library for an efficient testing.  
 Here are some screenshot of how testing was carried out:

 <br><br>

### We understand the including the evidence is sometimes necessary and we have included them here. We will take care of it from now. Thus we request you to please reevaluate our grades for last report based on this evidence. Once again, thanks for the amazing feedback!!

## Extra Features

### Additional to general testing, we decided to take a step further and include security measures to protect our site from various attacks which includes:

## 1. Denial of Services or Brute Force Attacks (Solution: Rate Limiting):

The Deniel of services attack can occur when a user from an IP is sending mulitple requests from the same IP with not good intentions. This continuous pining of the server can lead to crashing. To prevent this, we have implemented rate limiting which will prevent multiple requests from the same IP stopping the chance of a breakdown.

Used **Rate Limiter** library for this security concern.

In our server, we have a rate limit of over 100 requests from the same IP, but here as an example, we have shown a rate limit of 3 about how it will the server will responds to multiple requests from the same source:

After sending the first request,
![DOS 1](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DVHTEF5jDZavYZk6H-fK2qrmBcuz6haK)

 - The fields X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining are self explainiatory in this situation.

After sending all the 3 limit requests:

![DOS 2](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1t1qiyzxJSkOKU6ZPwj0fEZLTFmXmmgwi)

Hence stopping the DOS attack from breaking down the server!!

## 2. Secure HTTP Headers

Security headers are directives used by web applications to configure security defenses in web browsers. Based on these directives, browsers can make it harder to exploit client-side vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting or Clickjacking.

## 3. NoSQL Query Injection and XSS attacks (Solution: Data Sanitization)

NoSQL injection occurs when a query, most commonly delivered by an end-user, is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to include malicious input that executes an unwanted command on the database.  
For example:

Here instead of passing the email address, the user passes this particular string:

![NOSQL Query Injection](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1u04quuN2tocKMCOvO45HHOtD77-cNUaq)

This particular string with a common password let that user to log in the site wihout even having an account on the website.  
To prevent this we use mongoSanitize library for the website to prevent such strings from being added in the response body thus preventing these types of injections.


Apart from this, we have XSS attacks. To prevent this, we use another library which XSS, which will prevent injections of HTML code with javascript code attahced to them. Using this middleware, we convert all those HTML symbols.

### We have included many features which make the site experience invaluable but can't include all of them here, that's why we will show them in our final presentation and their importance for making the site function better, which was the main goal of this project.


## Feedback Plan

Currently we do not have a site published, but a setted up local environment. So for collecting feedback, we asked few friends, other students and staff members to provide a feedback for our project by showing the local dev environment.

After showing the products we asked every user to fill a google form for the site where we asked the questions which were based on user experience, Ease of User, comparison between the old site and the new one. By which we can take in consideration of the improvements that we have done and we can have more.

The feedback we recieved were a mix of positive and negative emotions.

## Stakeholders
Our Stakeholders at this moment are:
 - Innopolis University students and professors
 - 319 staff members
 - Team of the former InnoStore website

## Feedback analysis and improvements

### Changes in Features in frontend

After receiving feedback from stakeholders, friends, and mentor, we made several improvements to the frontend based on their suggestions. In addition to our original plan of features, we successfully implemented the search functionality, as well as sorting and filtering options for products. Moreover, we introduced admin privileges to facilitate the addition and removal of products. Furthermore, we addressed the issue of quantity synchronization, which was highlighted in the feedback we received.

**Feedback we received about the functionality of the website is that the new site doesn't have innopoints. As we have mentioned, earlier that our MVP will not have the feature of InnoPoints. We will focus on purchasing the items using real payment systems. We plan to include the Innopoints payment system in our plans after capstone project.** 

### Changes in features in Backend

1. No Payment system right now: It will be implemented in this week which is the final goal of our project.
2. Add more security measures.

## Next Plans

1. Incorporate Payment System.
2. Finish all the Admin Privileges.
3. Improve UI more based on the feedback recevied.
4. Prepare the final presentation.
5. Final packaging of the software.


## Plans after the Capstone

We will plan on incorporating the Innopoints system after the capstone project. Tanmay and Roukaya will be working on it after the capstone project ends.
