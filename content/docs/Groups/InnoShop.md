# InnoShop Weekly Task 1

The task for week 1 of the Capstone Project.

## Value Proposition

### Identifying the current problem:
The current problem faced by Innopolis University students is purchasing the universityâ€™s merchandise and other special services such as accommodation and cleaning services through the present InnoStore Website. The forementioned website has some bugs and other erros which need to be fixed. Due to this, sometimes the students may have to visit the student affairs office regarding purchasing anything. This fragmented approach can be time-consuming, inefficient, and may lead to limited availability of products and services.


### Solution provided by the website:
The proposed solution of the e-commerce website aims to address the identified problem by providing a comprehensive solution. But not only the website will serve as a centralized platform where students can easily browse, select, and purchase the university's merchandise and access special services but also allow them to present themselves as a freelancer and provide paid services in their field of interest in exchange for either innostore items or money. We will be working on ensuring a reliable online service that will provide a seamless experience.

2. Who are your target users or customers?  
The target users or customers of the website are the students of Innopolis University and the University staff itself. This includes both undergraduate and graduate students who are enrolled at the university and seek to purchase university merchandise, avail special services, and participate in project opportunities. Also, the researchers who needs to hire undergrads for not-so-expensive fees which also allows the students to get hands-on experience.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?  
To validate and test assumptions about the project, several strategies can be employed. Conducting user surveys and interviews can help gather feedback on the existing problems and needs of the students. Prototype testing can be done to evaluate the usability and functionality of the website. Additionally, collaborating with a small group of pilot users and collecting their feedback during the initial stages of the project can provide valuable insights and help validate assumptions.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?  
The success of the project can be measured using various metrics. Some potential metrics include:
a. Number of active users: Tracking the number of students who create profiles on the website, make purchases, or participate in projects.
b. Conversion rates: Monitoring the percentage of website visitors who become customers by making purchases or availing special services.
c. User satisfaction: Conducting surveys or collecting ratings and reviews to gauge user satisfaction levels.
Repeat customers: Measuring the number of customers who make multiple purchases or use the platform for project collaborations repeatedly.

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?  
User feedback is crucial for the growth and improvement of the startup. Regularly collecting feedback from users through surveys, interviews, and feedback forms will provide insights into areas that require iteration or potential pivots. This feedback can help identify user pain points, usability issues, or additional features that can enhance the overall experience. The startup can prioritize and analyze the feedback, categorize it into actionable items, and implement necessary changes accordingly. Iterations can be done in an agile manner, releasing new features or updates based on user feedback, and closely monitoring their impact on user engagement and satisfaction. If significant user feedback suggests a need for a substantial change in the business model or direction, the startup can consider pivoting and adjusting its strategy accordingly.


## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

The development team can leverage various resources to enhance the development and success of the above project. Here's how they can utilize AI, open source, and domain experts:

1. AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed to improve different aspects of the project. Here are a few examples:.
- Data analysis: The development team can use current markey trends and AI algorithms to analyze online available user data, such as browsing behavior, feedback, and reviews, to identify trends and insights that can inform University what kind of merchandise would be more likeable among students.
- Generative Tools: LLMs like Chat GPT can be used by the developers to speed up the development process to avoid writing redundant and boilerplate code. But not so much that the team entirely depends on the LLM instead of understanding the core mechanisms of the site which allow them to introduce new changes to the site if needed easily.

2. Open Source: Research relevant open source projects, frameworks, and libraries that align with the project's technical needs. Consider factors like community support, active development, and compatibility with existing technologies.

3. Expert in relevant domains: For having a headstart in developing the website, the development team can establish a connection with the team of the original InnoStore. Such collaboration will help in recreating the similar but more comfortable experience for the existent users of the website. Leverage their expertise, knowledge, and insights to guide the development process and ensure the project meets industry standards. And for the new features, the team can establish collaborations with industry professionals or companies in relevant domains for the same.


## Inviting other Students

The development team will always be open to invite other students to contribute to the startup. By hiring fellow students, the development team can tap into a pool of individuals who are familiar with the university ecosystem, understand the needs and preferences of their peers, and can provide valuable insights. Students can bring fresh perspectives, creativity, and enthusiasm to the team. Additionally, hiring students allows for the opportunity to provide them with real-world experience and foster a sense of community and collaboration within the university. It can also help distribute the workload effectively and ensure that the website development aligns closely with the target users' requirements.
