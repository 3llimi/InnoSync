### **Value Proposition**

- ####  The problem we are solving
    Our website addresses the challenges that freelancers commonly face, providing solutions for payment methods, dealing with scammers, and combating the pervasive issue of racism. Freelancing platforms often exhibit discriminatory practices, such as offering different hourly rates based on nationality. Additionally, certain geographical locations may be barred from accessing these platforms due to sanctions and political considerations. Our platform aims to create a fair and inclusive environment, eliminating these barriers and fostering equal opportunities for all freelancers.

- #### Solution description
    Our solution combines the advantages of peer-to-peer architecture with centralized control to effectively address the aforementioned problems. While peer-to-peer architecture helps mitigate many issues, it falls short in dealing with scammers and ensuring website content remains safe. To overcome these challenges, our platform adopts a centralized approach. We prioritize user privacy by not requiring or allowing the disclosure of nationalities. Additionally, we facilitate payments using cryptocurrencies for enhanced security and convenience.

    To prevent fraud and disputes, we employ a unique approach. Initially, the platform securely holds the cryptocurrency within its wallet until both the freelancer and job owner reach an agreement on the project. In case of conflicts, our dedicated administrators step in to manually assess the project's completion and determine the appropriate distribution of funds. This ensures fair resolution and minimizes the risk of financial loss for both parties involved.

- #### Benefits to Users    
    At our website, freelancers and service providers enjoy a multitude of benefits. We prioritize inclusivity by removing nationality-based restrictions, ensuring equal opportunities for all users based solely on their skills and expertise. Additionally, our payment system significantly reduces transfer fees, allowing freelancers to retain a higher portion of their earned income. By offering these advantages, we enhance the overall experience, making freelancing more rewarding and convenient for our valued users.

- #### Differentiation
    Unlike many platforms, we do not ask for or restrict users based on their nationality. Furthermore, our platform supports payment with cryptocurrencies, offering enhanced security and convenience for users. By securely holding funds in our website's wallet until project agreements are reached, we provide a fair and transparent process for resolving conflicts

- #### User Impact
    The adoption of our new payment method brings a significant positive impact on users. It eliminates numerous limitations that currently exist in the industry, transforming the way freelancers and service providers operate. Unlike existing websites that impose restrictions based on specific locations and pay discrepancies based on nationalities, our platform fosters equal opportunities for all.

- #### User Testimonials or Use Cases
    The website will be accessable for everyone intersted in freelancing without any limits. The value of this platfrom can be as huge as websites like freelancer.com wich worth <a href="https://freelancersincubator.com/question/1372/how_much_is_freelancer.com_worth#:~:text=It's%20worth%20about%20%241%20billion,Amsterdam%2C%20Beijing%2C%20Mumbai">1 billion dollars</a>

    - Open-source frameworks and libraries provide a solid foundation for building web applications. By utilizing these resources, we can accelerate development, reduce costs, and benefit from the contributions and support of the open-source community.
    - Analyze relevant open source existing-platforms functionalities and compare performance of our functionalities with them in order to enhance it. 

- Experts in relevant domains:
    - We will try to make discussion with experts about testing and implementation, collect their feedback and advices.
    - As stated in lectures one of the founders of Kazan Express will be a guest lecture, we will try to learn a lot of things from him, since both of our project is similar in some aspects.

## **Inviting Other Students**

- Since now we have few members, new members are welcome to discuss with us about the idea of the project and join our team.
- Also we might invite new members from front-end course to help us to design the front-end interface of our website.

    ![Use Case](/fairlance/usecase.jpg)

- ###  **Tech Stack**:
    Our platform will use many frameworks and technologies. They can not all be defined from the start, since our view will be developing and we might need different frameworks to do different tasks. However, we will mainly focus on the following technologies:

    - Flask: we will mainly use flask for the backend part of our project to deal with customers, manage the database, and support mechanism. 
    - MySQL: will be our data base management system
    - React: for the front-end part 
    - Brownie/hardhat: for intaracting with solidity
    - Solidity: for writing smart contracts
    - Moralis: for wallet managemnt (front-end part of intaracting with solidity)


- ### **Anticipating Future Problems**:
    1. Technical complexities: we need to develop a robust and scalable platform with features such as user management, job posting, payment processing, and messaging.
    Mitigation: break the whole project into smaller modules and develop them iteratively.
    2. Resource limitations: we may face server capacity, memory limitations. In addition, we may not have the necessary skill set for some parts of the project.
    Mitigation: upgrade the server and/or use optimized data structures/algorithms. Delegate some parts of the project to another team that specializes in that particular area.
    3. Time constraints: meet project deadlines and provide a functional platform within the specified time frame.
    Mitigation: we will make a project plan with milestones and deadlines. we will follow it and adjust it as needed.
    4.  External dependencies: using third-party services or APIs for some functionality.
    Mitigation: choosing the most reliable services or developing your own.

**Feedback**  
I think, your project is impressive! A **fair** freelance website that utilizes cryptocurrency and prioritizes user protection is an innovative concept, which surprisingly still doesn't exist. Your team's dedication and strong collaboration are evident, and it's great to see that you have a clear vision for the project.

Considering that our course aims to achieve a minimal viable product (MVP) by the end of the semester, I would suggest focusing on scaling down the project to create a web app that encompasses the core functionalities. This approach will allow you to build a solid foundation that can be expanded and enhanced in the future.

To ensure efficient execution within our limited timeframe of already six weeks, I recommend outlining the main features of your project and prioritizing their development. It's essential to identify specific areas that can be streamlined or simplified without compromising the core functionality.{{< /hint >}}
