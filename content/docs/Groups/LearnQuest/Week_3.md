# **Week #3**

## **Developing the first prototype, creating the priority list**

## **Progress report**:

- **Prototype Features**: 
- The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/abuwho/LearnQuest). All instructions to run the application have been included in the `README` files for frontend and backend. 

- **Backend**: 
- The endpoints that have been implemented using Django/Python: 
    - Authentication endpoints

    - Courses endpoints

 - **User Interface**: 
 - **Frontend**: 
- A list of components and pages that have been developed
    - Logo ![Logo](/LearnQuest/logo.svg)
    - Register ![Register page demo](/LearnQuest/register-demo.jpg)
    - Sign in ![Sign in page demo](/LearnQuest/sign-in-demo.jpg)
    - Landing ![Landing page demo](/LearnQuest/landing-page-demo.png)
    - Courses ![Courses page demo](/LearnQuest/courses-demo.jpg)
    - Checkout ![Checkout page demo](/LearnQuest/checkout-demo.jpg)
    - Reviews ![Reviews page demo](/LearnQuest/reviews-demo.jpg)

 - **Challenges and Solutions**: 
 - Confusions regarding the switch between `sqlite` to `PostGres` from development to production. We decided that we are going to fix it by using `sqlite` in the development environment (which is used by default on Django) and later we will use `Postgres` in deployment. 
 - We had some difficulties in building components in Next.js/React.js. However, we solved it by getting help online. 

- **Next Steps**: 
- Implement more endpoints for applications such as User Profiles, Cart, Checkout, etc. 
- Implement testing in backend
- Making sure the frontend and backend integrations are more seamless. 
- Implement GitHub's build tools to effectively monitor successful deploying.

**Prototype Features**<br>
Where are the features ? Please write everything requested in the report or leave a link for quick access.

**User Interface**<br>
AMAZING!!!
Very nice design. But did you test it with users ?

**Challenges and Solutions**<br>
Good!, but seems like not depending changes you faced. Which I hope itâ€™s true

Another example of challenges are you might face:

- Testing and Quality Assurance: Finding and fixing bugs can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if testing is not well planned.
- User Experience: Designing intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces is not straightforward and needs continuous refinement based on user feedback.
- Technical debt: Rapid development or lack of proper design may lead to poor quality code, making future changes harder.
- Integration problems: It's often challenging to integrate different components, especially when they're developed by different teams or use different technologies.
  **Next Steps**<br>
  Good. You should relay think of testing (Usability testing)

**Overall**<br>
Good report, you should focus more on finalising the project. and test it with real users.

**Grade<br> 4.5/5**
