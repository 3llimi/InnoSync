# **Week #5**

Welcome to Week 5 of our Capstone Project! 

- The first and the foremost part of our development efforts of the solution is the implementation of necessary changes. In this case, we refactored our business logic, polished it, and dockerized our backend service for easier setup. Along this process, we also made sure to fix logical faults in our application so the business logic is implemented correctly. The code repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/abuwho/LearnQuest).

- Regarding stakeholders: we came up with the idea of the capstone project on our own. Therefore, there is not an existing stakeholder for this project as for business. However, we are keen on collaborating with people experienced/interested in Product Analysis, Product Management, and UX Research. 

- Regarding analytics: As our application is currently running on our development server, we do not have an analytics collection system in place. Also, it hasn't been planned by our team to make this solution as a business solution in the market. Therefore, the necessity of creating analytics functionalities has been downplayed. 

- Future potential UX Research: At the moment, our web application has core functionalities such as authentication, CRUD operations on existing entities, such as Profile, User, Course, CourseEnrollment, Lesson, Review, InstructorApplication, Wallet, Cart. These functionalities offered with a user-friendly interface should be enough for a user for successful interaction. However, based on User Experience (UX) Research, we are open to enhance the usefulness of our application even more in the future. Just like the feedback we had received on our prototype on 3rd week, these tools (like user interviews and surveys) will keep on helping us in improvement the experience of the users. It is important to note that creation of UX research from the point of view of product management requires at least 2 weeks. As a result, we have decided it would be a good idea to present our findings in the end of the project if time allows it. This procedure has been included in our backlog. 

- As for documentation of feedback, we have the data available in the form of Google sheets for the feedback we have received from early testers of our application, which can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDbv9b7W85yxISFLbOUFtVZne6LUJuX-/edit?usp=sharing).

- Feedback analyzing has been tricky because the responses we have received in a early stage of the product has a relatively small sample size (n = 27). For this reason, we did not find too many recurring issues in our implementation. 

- For prioritizing our tasks, we paid attention to the scope of the product at the MVP stage. In this regard, we have tried to follow the impact/effort matrix, as shown below:

Following this method has helped us prioritize in a short-term project.
