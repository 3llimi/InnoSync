# **Week #4**

Welcome to Week 4 of our Capstone Project! This week is dedicated to the crucial phases of testing, feedback integration, and continuous iteration.

## **Progress report**  


## **External Feedback**
We have received feedback from a survey based on our first prototype in dev environment [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4_dGe32kgBBy1LTaD1mpZg3FaW119kB_nNCoxNZNY8eOW3g/viewform). 

The responses we received are displayed below:

3. ![Result 3](/LearnQuest/survey-result-3.png)

## **Testing**

We have written unit tests for testing our Models, Serializers and Utility Functions in the Django backend. The tests can be viewed on [GitHub repo](https://github.com/abuwho/LearnQuest).

Also, we have conducted end-to-end testing for our API endpoints using [drf-yasj](https://drf-yasg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/readme.html). It helped us identify potential loopholes in the backend request-response model, related to authentication and HTTP response codes. Moreover, it helped us test the robustness of our backend. 

Furthermore, we have conducted end-to-end testing for the frontend components and make relevant changes based on any potentially broken components in the UI. 

During the testing process, we tried to follow the [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) guidelines. 


## **Iteration**

Based on the feedback received from the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4_dGe32kgBBy1LTaD1mpZg3FaW119kB_nNCoxNZNY8eOW3g/viewform), we have added some features to develop after the release of our MVP by the end of the course. 

Key features include: 
1. Adding Russian payment gateways such as (Mir, Yoomoney, SberPay, etc.)
2. Feature to gift a course to a friend
3. Free trial

However, it is important to note that abovementioned features will be implemented after the release of the MVP for future iterations.

**Feedback**  

**External Feedback**<br>
Very Good, but maybe better to follow some kind of User statisifaction metrics like NPS to better utilise this feedback.

Now how will you adapt to this feedback?


**Testing**<br>
Ok you you made testing, where is the proof?

Please show proof of what you are saying that you were doing.
For example how much code coverage you cover?


**Iteration**<br>

Good plan but keep in mind:

An iteration plan is essentially the plan for an upcoming iteration. It would typically outline:
* The goals and objectives for the iteration: what the team aims to achieve.
* The features to be developed.
* The tasks needed to develop these features. This might include coding, testing, design tasks, etc.
* Any assumptions or dependencies.
* A timeline for the iteration.


**Overall**<br>
The report is ok. your report doesnâ€™t reflect your work. I Think you should spent more time reflecting / writing the report.

**Grade: 4.5/5**
