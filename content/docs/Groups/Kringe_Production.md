**Elaborate Explanations:**
In Progress...


# Report for Week 2
## Component Breakdown 

We use **Nuxt**, **Djang**o and **MongoDB** to build the application.  Main components:

1. **Frontend**: Nuxt, a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces. Nuxt can communicate with Django via REST API to retrieve data from the database.

2. **Backend**: Django, a Python-based web framework. Django can communicate with MongoDB via ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to load data from the database into applications.

3. **Database**: MongoDB, MongoDB can communicate with Django via REST APIs to exchange data between applications.

The responsibilities of components and modules can be defined as follows:
- Frontend (Nuxt):
  - Creating the user interface
  - Processing user requests
  - Interacting with Django's REST API to handle data

- Backend (Django):
  - Data processing.
  - Generating a RESTful API for interacting with Nuxt
  - Working with MongoDB via ORM to upload and save data

- Database (MongoDB):
  - Storing data
  - Providing access to data via ORM

Interaction between components and modules can occur as follows:
- Nuxt receives a request from a user and sends it to Django's server via the **RESTful API**.
- **Django** processes the request and returns a **JSON** response.
- **MongoDB** receives data from **Django** and stores it in its database.
- **Django** loads the data from **MongoDB** and sends it to the **user** for display through the UI.

## Data Management

Our application does not require transaction support and at the same time we need the ability to store complex, tree-like structures (courses, messages). Thus, we should use a document-oriented DBMS (e.g. MongoDB) to store information about users, courses, files and discussions. The data will be accessed through the driver of the corresponding database.
## User Interface (UI) Design
Now we have the first version of the main page of the site. In the attached file you can see the layout of the main page.

![Main Page](/kringe_production_images/Main_Page.jpg)
![Sign In Log In Page](/kringe_production_images/Sign_In_Log_In_Page.jpg)



## Integration and APIs
Assess any external systems, services, or APIs that need to be integrated into your application. Plan how these integrations will be implemented and how data will flow between systems.

At the moment, there is no urgent need to use third-party resources, but we have some ideas on how to improve and diversify our system in the future.

**Cloud Storage APIs**: We can integrate cloud storage APIs like Google Drive API, Dropbox API, or Microsoft OneDrive API to allow students to upload and share educational materials with large sizes. 

**Social Media APIs**: Integrating social media APIs, such as Facebook API or Twitter API, can enable students to share updates, discuss homework, and engage in conversations related to the courses. These APIs provide features like authentication, posting updates, and retrieving content.

**Communication and Messaging APIs**: To facilitate real-time communication and collaboration, we can consider integrating APIs like Twilio for SMS and voice communication, or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications in mobile applications.

**Learning Management System (LMS) APIs**: Our project aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience, we can integrate with popular LMS platforms such as Moodle, Canvas, or Blackboard. These platforms often provide APIs that allow you to access course materials, enroll students, and manage assignments.

We also have an idea that will allow you to access files from the service via **telegram**. This will be possible if the user's alias is specified in the telegram during registration, making him an accredited user.

## Scalability and Performance
We assume that students of Innopolis University will be able to use our service. Therefore, the supposed load on **normal** days will **not exceed 5 requests per minute**. However, we anticipate that students will be more active in browsing the forum pages during exam weeks. Based on this, we planned to use several techniques to maintain stable operation:  

**Asynchronous Processing**. For example, when a user attaches a document to a post, instead of processing it synchronously, we are planning process task asynchronously in the background.This helps maintain responsiveness and improves scalability.
**Denial-of-Service (DoS) Protection**: Use rate limiting techniques to prevent an individual user or IP address from overwhelming your application with excessive requests. For instance, we plan to create a rate limit of 10 rps. 
**Queue of resource-intensive user actions**: When the site will be carrying out a lot of resource-intensive processes, users will be queued to ensure stable operation of the service. For example, if there are a lot of users trying to upload or download files from the service, then  users will be placed in a queue to not overload the service in one moment.

*We will keep these plans in mind during development, however for the MVP we will only use simpler stability techniques such as limiting the rate.*
## Security and Privacy
**Authentication**:
We have chosen cookie-based authentication for our web application. During the authentication process, we will verify the user's credentials and create a session with a unique identifier. Additionally, we have divided users into two roles: "student" and "admin". This allows us to provide different access rights and functionality for each role.

**Secure Connection**:
To ensure the security of data transmission, we will use the HTTPS protocol. Encrypting data between the client and server will help prevent interception and tampering of information by third parties.

**User Data Encryption**:
Critical user data, such as passwords, will be encrypted on the client-side before being sent to the server. We recommend using strong encryption algorithms, such as bcrypt, to ensure the security of stored passwords in the database. This will help protect users' confidential data in case of a potential database compromise.

**Protection Against XSS Vulnerabilities**:
To prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, we recommend using the "httpOnly" flag when setting cookies. This restricts cookie access through JavaScript and reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access to user credentials.

**Input Data Handling**:
During application development, we must pay close attention to handling user input. Validating and filtering input data will help prevent attacks such as SQL injections or scripting vulnerabilities.

**Authorization and Access Control**:
For the administrator role, we need to carefully control access and editing capabilities for posts. Access rights verification and authorization should be implemented on the server-side to prevent unauthorized access and data modification.

## Error Handling and Resilience
Plan for handling errors and exceptions to maintain a reliable and resilient application. Define strategies for error logging, monitoring, and graceful error recovery.

1. **Logging errors**:
We plan to use sentry framework for error logging. Each incoming error will have its own marking depending on its severity.

2. **Centralized error monitoring**: 
Sentry will also be used as a centralized error monitoring system. There it will be possible to analyze trends and error patterns in order to identify recurring problems and take measures to prevent them. We can also set up critical error notifications in Sentry to quickly respond and fix errors.

3. **Error recovery**:
We will use the built-in development tools to catch and track errors that occur. We implement such an error mechanism to provide the user with meaningful error messages, while avoiding the disclosure of confidential information. If the error cannot be resolved without the developer's intervention, then it will be blocked and the developer will be notified immediately.

4. **Automated testing**:
In order to ensure the reliability of the system already at the development stage, we will use automated testing. It will make it easier to catch errors and will not allow you to release incorrectly working changes in the release.

## Deployment and DevOps
We  want to use **GitHub Actions** for our DevOps practices. So we will use Git as a version control system. Also we are planning using following techniques:

**Continuous Integration (CI)**: we are planning to implement a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate build, set linter and test processes. 
**Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Set up a CD pipeline to automate the deployment process. we are supposed to use GitHub Actions to deploy our application to the appropriate environment based on triggers, such as branch merges or tags.
Thus, we are planning to include automated tests, such as unit tests and end-to-end tests, in the CI/CD pipeline. Our back-end will be write on Python, so we can use library pytest to test it. And for front-end we will use service Cypress.

## **Development Report** 

**Problems and Difficulties**

During the development of the project on the Django platform, we encountered several problems and difficulties, especially considering our previous experience of developing on the platform.NET.

**The main problems we have encountered:**

The need to learn a new programming language - Python.
Architectural differences of Django from .NET, requiring rethinking of design patterns and development approaches.
Lack of an integrated development environment, requiring the search and configuration of a suitable development environment for Django.
We also had to get used to the Django architecture, including the MTV model (Model-Template-View), which required time and adaptation to the new roles and responsibilities of each component.

All these difficulties were overcome thanks to our perseverance, study and application of new knowledge and skills in development on the Django platform.

From the problems of developing the front part of the project, the problem of accessing two different servers via one port was identified, which was solved by our developers through a reverse proxy.

**Feedback**  
I am impressed by the prototype features you have developed. The main page of the forum, with its user-friendly interface, will make it easy for students to engage in discussions, and access relevant resources. The sidebar with course navigation will enable seamless navigation between courses, enhancing the overall user experience. The user interface of UniHub, as showcased in the provided screenshots, looks clean and intuitive - good job on that. 

The differentiation of UniHub as a platform tailored specifically for university students sets it apart from other generic resources. I think you may want to frame your project as essentially a social network with enhanced features for University students. 

Also, appreciate your transparency in sharing the problems and difficulties faced during the development process. It is evident that your team's perseverance and dedication will help you get through. 

Good job, 5/5 for the week!

# **Week #4**

## **External Feedback:**
Gathering feedback from our target audience has been a top priority for us. We have taken initiative to collect valuable firsthand feedback from our community, our friends in university. Their perspectives and insights have been immensely helpful in assessing the usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction with our forum platform. For example, one of the testers noted that if he does not remember what year the course was in, then finding it can be a little problematic and suggested doing something like an input field for searching by course name. Another user mentioned that a button to change site's theme would be a great addition. This kind of feedback serves as a basis for our upcoming refinements and iterations, allowing us to enhance user experience and make necessary improvements. We are grateful for honest feedback received, which has played a vital role in shaping direction of our project.

## **Testing:**
Testing is an essential aspect of our development process, and we have made significant progress in this area. We conducted load testing using K6 to evaluate performance of our platform. During testing, we simulated various scenarios, such as having 100 users for a few minutes to simulate exam-related load, and using 350 users for a minute to test stress conditions. In case of stress test we encountered a 42% request failure rate, which highlights need for further optimization. However, we have planned to address these issues on next week or after minimum viable product (MVP) stage. Additionally, we performed testing with 50 users for 30 minutes to simulate normal usage of forum. Furthermore, we ensured that our database is functioning correctly and we tested our server to verify its stability. These testing efforts have provided us with valuable insights into the user experience, allowing us to identify areas for improvement and address any issues or bugs that arose during development.

## **Iteration:**
In past week, we have made significant progress in terms of iteration and refinement. We have regularly assessed our project's progress, comparing it against our initial goals and objectives. Based on feedback we collected, we made and will continue to make necessary adjustments and refinements to our design, features, and functionalities. This iterative approach has allowed us to create a product that continuously evolves and improves. While it may seem challenging to iterate on early version of project, we recognize that this is opportunity to eliminate most of mistakes and make substantial improvements. 

Throughout this week, we have made improvements to front-end, created database, tested it and server, and collected valuable feedback from our friends. These efforts have significantly contributed to our progress, and we are determined to continue iterating and refining our platform to ensure a seamless user experience.

## **Week 5**
This week, we proactively scheduled meetings and interviews with users and fellow students. By engaging in direct conversations, we aim to collect valuable feedback on the current version of UniHub. This feedback will provide insights into usability, functionality and overall satisfaction of our product. We believe that gathering broader feedback will help us refine and enhance **UniHub** to better meet needs of our target users.

This plan includes specific questions and areas of focus to gather feedback on, covering aspects such as usability, functionality and overall satisfaction.  Online forms or surveys enable users to quantitatively assess our product and its features, providing us with valuable data to analyze and incorporate into our refinements.

We will conduct user surveys and feedback sessions to gather input on UniHub's usability, functionality and overall satisfaction. These sessions will provide us with direct insights into users' experiences and perspectives, allowing us to understand their needs and expectations better. By actively engaging users in the feedback process, we can make informed decisions and prioritize improvements based on their input.

Throughout feedback collection process, we diligently document all feedback received from our friends. This documentation ensures that specific areas of improvement or enhancement are clearly identified and recorded. By documenting feedback, we can refer back to it during refinement and implementation stages, ensuring that we address all relevant suggestions and concerns.

Based on the feedback received and prioritization process, we implement necessary enhancements to UniHub. These changes carried out following our project's development process, ensuring that each modification is carefully integrated into existing system. By following structured approach, we can effectively incorporate user feedback and continuously improve functionality and user experience of UniHub.

**User Feedback:**

We have received valuable feedback from our users, which has been instrumental in shaping the further development of **UniHub**. Here are some examples of feedback we have collected:
