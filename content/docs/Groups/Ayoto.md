**Feedback**  


**1. Component Breakdown**

Good, but you need to categorise those mention into Frontend/ backend.

**2. Data Management**

Good

**3. UI Design**

I like the design very much. But what the Landing page different design than the mobile app? 
Try to keep consistent design among platforms in order not to confuse users. 

I like the chat design, but it missing the send button. also how will you handle if the user will write a big prompt? 

**4. Integration and APIs**

Missing

**5. Scalability and Performance**
Good

**6. Security and Privacy**
Good

**7. Error handling and Resillience**
Unit testing will help you test the alit of the current code. But this is only one part of handling errors. You need to use a mechanise to handle errors while he program are in production. 
Since you are suing Mobile try to use crashlytics 

**8. Deployment and DevOps**
Good

**Answering questioner**
Answering for the questioner is very short, and doesn’t reflect much consideration. 
You should explain why you don’t have a mentor. 
I hardly believe that you have no gap in your knowledge ( so you are perfect at everything? )

You should redo them.

> We couldn’t find mentors to guide us in developing the project.

The mentor job is not all about the challenges. beside you didn't face any challenge?.
 
please try to be more realistic.

**Overall**
The report is good. But you should really take into consideration the questioner answering properly. If you did it you would have gotten a full mark.

and try to be more realistic.

Grade 4/5

# Week 4 Report

## External feedback
We have gathered feedback from 8 people about our prototype. The feedback was mainly about their opinion about the idea of the prototype and the functionality of the chatbot. The feedback was mostly positive, but we also got some negative feedback and some suggestions for some of the features.

One of the persons who tested the prototype was concerned about the privacy of the data. Also, we got a suggestion that after a user finishes the chat with the bot, we should be mainly showing a list of doctors and hospitals which are covered by his insurance. We will consider the feedback and suggestions we got to make our product better.

## Testing 
We have used manual testing to test the prototype and we discovered several bugs that we need to work on.

In the website, we discovered some bugs such as that some messages from the chat don't appear properly when using the website in the mobile view. Also, the chat needs to be auto-scrolling to the bottom when there are new messages. We also noticed a delay in the chat when sending messages. Our front end developer is working on fixing these bugs.

In the mobile application, team members responsible for testing faced a client exception error. There were also some problems in the functionality of the chat. The errors have been reported to the flutter developers to be fixed.

## Iteration and refinement
From the testing phase, we discovered some bugs that we need to fix in our website. Our front end developer is currently working on fixing these bugs. We also discovered some errors in the mobile application and our flutter developers are working on it.

Additionally, we received some feedback from users and we will be considering it while developing the prototype. For example, we will be considering the feedback we got about the privacy of the data. We also added in our tasks list to implement the suggestion we got about showing the user a list of doctors and hospitals which are covered by his insurance.

On top of that, our team is also working on implementing the rest of the features in the prototype.

<a href="https://ibb.co/VpnSwh4"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/M5wVBj0/q5.png" alt="q5" border="0"></a>

From the feedback we collected, we found that most of the users liked the idea of the prototype and they find it useful. Also, most of the users found the chatbot easy to use and they liked the design of the chatbot. However, some users reported some problems regarding their experience with the platform. We will be considering the feedback we got to make our product better.

## Feedback Collection Plan
To ensure systematic and standardized feedback collection, we will be following the follwoing methods:

### 1. Algorithmic Feedback Collection
Online forms and charts will be created to quantitatively assess the product or its specific features. This approach will allow for the collection of standardized feedback from a larger user base. The online forms will be designed to capture relevant metrics such as usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction.

### 2. One-on-One Feedback Sessions:
One-on-One Feedback Sessions:
In addition to the algorithmic approach, individual user surveys and feedback sessions will be conducted. These sessions will provide an opportunity for users to provide detailed feedback, share their experiences, and suggest improvements. The sessions will be structured using specific questions or areas of focus to gather feedback on.

By following this feedback collection plan, we aim to gather comprehensive and valuable insights, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the product's strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

## Feedback Documentation
All feedback received from stakeholders will be carefully documented to ensure clear identification of specific areas for improvement or enhancement. Each feedback item will be attributed to the respective stakeholder and categorized based on the identified themes or issues. This documentation will serve as a reference for further analysis and prioritization.

## Feedback Analysis and Prioritization
The feedback collected will be analyzed to identify the most common themes or issues. These themes will be prioritized based on the frequency of occurrence and the severity of the issue. The prioritized themes will be used to guide the development of the product roadmap and the prioritization of future features.

## Implementation of changes
Some users reported bugs and suggestions to improve the UX of the prototype such as the auto scrolling feature in the chatbot. Our developers are currently working on fixing these bugs and implementing the suggestions we got from the users.

## Refinement of Product Roadmap
We have refined our road map based on the feedback we recieved and the problems we discovered during developing and testing the platform. One of the main aspects we decided to change is to develop our own AI chatbot in the future instead of using a third party chatbot.

 We received some comments from the users about the performance of the current chatbot but we are not able to modify them as we are not the owners of the chatbot. Therefore, we decided to develop our own chatbot in the future to have more control over it and improve its performance.

Our Roadmap after Refinment is shown in the following image:
