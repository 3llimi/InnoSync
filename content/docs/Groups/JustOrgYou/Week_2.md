- [ ] Provide architecture
  - [ ] **Component Breakdown**: Identify the major components and modules that will
        form your software solution. Outline their responsibilities and interactions
        to ensure a cohesive structure.
  - [ ] **Data Management**: Determine how data will be stored, accessed, and
        manipulated within your application. Select appropriate databases or data
        storage solutions based on the project's requirements.
  - [ ] **User Interface (UI) Design**: Consider the user experience (UX) and design
        principles when planning your UI. Sketch wireframes or create mockups to
        visualize the layout and flow of your application.
  - [ ] **Integration and APIs**: Assess any external systems, services, or APIs that
        need to be integrated into your application. Plan how these integrations will
        be implemented and how data will flow between systems.
  - [ ] **Scalability and Performance**: Anticipate future growth and consider
        scalability aspects when designing the architecture. Ensure that your
        application can handle increasing user loads and data volumes without
        compromising performance.
  - [ ] **Security and Privacy**: Incorporate appropriate security measures into your
        architecture to protect user data and safeguard against potential
        vulnerabilities. Consider authentication, authorization, encryption, and
        other relevant security practices.
  - [ ] **Error Handling and Resilience**: Plan for handling errors and exceptions to
        maintain a reliable and resilient application. Define strategies for error
        logging, monitoring, and graceful error recovery.
  - [ ] **Deployment and DevOps**: Consider the deployment process and DevOps
        practices that align with your chosen tech stack. Automate deployment tasks,
        implement version control, and establish a robust development workflow.
- [ ] Choose tech stack
  - [ ] Evaluate the requirements and objectives of the project
  - [ ] Consider important factors (e.g. performance, security, scalability,
        expertise of team members)
  - [ ] Determine most suitable technologies
- [ ] Questionnaire
  - [ ] **Tech Stack Resources**: Are you utilizing any **project-based books** that
        specifically cover your tech stack and help you build your project? If yes,
        please provide the names of these books (name at least 3). How do you
        anticipate utilizing these materials to enhance your knowledge and expertise
        in your tech stack?
  - [ ] **Mentorship Support**: Do you currently have a mentor actively involved in your
        project? If yes, kindly share the name of your mentor and explain how their
        guidance has positively influenced your project. If you don't have a mentor
        yet, have you considered seeking one? How do you believe having a mentor
        could contribute to the success of your project? Remember, having an
        experienced mentor that can guide you and your team is your responsibility.
  - [ ] **Exploring Alternative Resources**: In addition to project-based books, what
        other resources have you explored to expand your understanding of your tech
        stack? This could include online courses, video tutorials, documentation, or
        any other sources that have been valuable in filling knowledge gaps. Please,
        name at least 3 resources
  - [ ] **Identifying Knowledge Gaps**: Are there any specific areas within your tech
        stack where you or your team feel there are knowledge gaps or expertise is
        lacking? If so, how do you plan to address these gaps and ensure a
        well-rounded understanding of your chosen technologies? Please name the tech
        stack division in your team and outline how are you planning to deal with
        **knowledge gaps**
  - [ ] **Engaging with the Tech Community**: Have you actively engaged with the broader
        tech community to seek guidance or learn from experienced professionals in
        your tech stack? This could involve participating in online forums and groups
        (telegram, discord or any other platform), attending local meetups (Kazan,
        Innopolis)? Do you have means to engage experts into critical tech stack
        problems through professional networks?
  - [ ] **Learning Objectives**: What specific learning objectives have you set for
        yourself and your team in relation to your tech stack this week? How do you
        plan to achieve these objectives, and what strategies or resources will you
        employ to deepen your understanding?
  - [ ] **Sharing Knowledge with Peers**: How have you been sharing your knowledge and
        expertise with your teammates? Have you organized any knowledge-sharing
        sessions or discussions to facilitate the exchange of insights and
        experiences related to your tech stack?
  - [ ] **Laveraging AI**:How have you leveraged AI to compensate for any lacking expertise in your
        tech stack? Have you utilized AI-powered tools or platforms to expedite the
        process of acquiring knowledge and expertise in your tech stack?
- [ ] Tech Stack and Team Allocation
