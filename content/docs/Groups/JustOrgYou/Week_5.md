# Week #5 Report

## TODO

- [ ] Schedule meetings or interviews with relevant stakeholders, such as
  potential clients, users, or fellow students, to collect feedback on the
  current product version. Remember, goal fo the week to have a broader feedback
  and better refinement.
- [ ] Prepare a feedback collection plan, including the specific questions or
  areas of focus to gather feedback on. Consider using an algorithmic ways to
  collect standardized feedback (online forms or online charts where users can
  quantitatively assess your product or its features) in addition to one on one
  meetings.
- [ ] Conduct user surveys or feedback sessions to gather input on the product’s
  usability, functionality, and overall satisfaction.
- [ ] Document feedback received from stakeholders, ensuring clear
  identification of specific areas of improvement or enhancement.
- [ ] Analyze the feedback collected to identify common themes, patterns, or
  recurring issues.
- [ ] Prioritize the feedback based on its impact and feasibility of
  implementation.
- [ ] For those who are willing to continue their projects after Capstone -
  discuss and refine the product roadmap based on the feedback and identified
  improvements. This can include feature addition plan for the next months or
  even a year. Time flies fast, and having a thoroughly refined plan is always
  better than just development on your feel about the product.
- [ ] Implement necessary changes or enhancements to the product based on the
  feedback received, following the project’s development process.
