### **Value Proposition**

- **Identify the Problem:**
Our beloved city, Innopolis, is situated at a distance from Kazan city. While this location offers numerous benefits, such as beautiful natural surroundings and a tight-knit community, it presents a challenge when it comes to traveling to places of interest like the airport or Kazan itself. Despite the availability of public transportation, citizens often encounter transportation issues. Our project aims to address this problem and provide a solution.

- **Solution Description:**
Can be found below in the **Defining the Vision for Your Project** section




- **Benefits to Users:**
The main benefit of our project is the opportunity for users to save money on transportation costs. Additionally, our project will provide a convenient and reliable means of transportation, particularly for routes that may have limited public transportation options.
Furthermore, we believe that our project will foster social connections and community building. By providing an easy way to find travel companions, we envision the potential for friendships to form and even new startup opportunities to arise.

- **Differentiation:**
Our main differentiating factor from other existing solutions is our ability to leverage Innopolis's strong sense of community. With our project, users not only reduce costs but also find compatible travel companions.
The current local solutions, such as the 'Иннополис попутчики' and 'Taxi иннополис' Telegram groups, have significant drawbacks. The messages in these groups are exclusively in Russian, making them inaccessible to some citizens of Innopolis. Furthermore, in our focus group session, the majority of respondents who use those groups (18 out of 20 people) expressed their dissatisfaction, highlighting the groups' current state as unusable.

- **Testimonials or Use Cases:**
Use case: 
There are several citizens in Innopolis who want to travel from Kazan airport to Innopolis and would be interested in sharing a ride. However, they are unaware of each other or available drivers in our community.
Our project aims to connect these individuals with each other and with drivers in our community. By facilitating communication and coordination, we will help them find suitable travel companions and arrange shared rides.


## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

1. **What problem or need does your software project address?**
    - Our project will address the challenge of finding travel companions for trips between specific locations within specified timeframes. It will provide a solution for both types of travelers: those who are seeking a ride and those who are willing to offer one.
2. **Who are your target users or customers?**
    - Innopolis citizens
3. **How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?**
    - To develop the MVP of our project, we conducted a focus group and analyzed the shortcomings of existing solutions. Following the MVP phase, we will incorporate user feedback and make necessary improvements.
4. **What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?**
    - We will monitor the number of users and gather their feedback.
5. **How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?** 
    - As mentioned earlier, we will collect user feedback after the release of the MVP.
    - We will analyze the feedback to identify the most critical and impactful issues.
    - During a meetup, we will establish specific integration goals.
    - Our team leader will add the corresponding task to the git repository.
    - A team member will assign the task to themselves and proceed with its implementation.
    - Thorough testing will be performed to ensure the quality of the feature.
    - Once testing is complete, we will deploy the feature.
    - We will then return to step 1 and repeat the feedback-gathering process.


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):**
In the current state of implementing the MVP of the project, we envision utilizing AI in the following ways:
    1. For team members who have a tech stack not directly related to the project (e.g., C#), tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can be immensely helpful in bridging the syntactical differences between programming languages.
    2. Certain blocks of code or functions can be generated entirely using AI. This has the potential to expedite the development process and increase efficiency.
    3. Every week, we are assigned the task of writing a significant report. Initially, we tried to work on it as a group, but we soon realized that this approach was inefficient. We found ourselves repeating information, and the report lacked proper structure and consistency.
    To overcome this issue we assigned technical writer (Ayaz Safin).
    During the writing process, I utilized a template provided by our Capstone project instructors to maintain a consistent flow of information. Additionally, I used ChatGPT to review and revise each section, ensuring accuracy and minimizing spelling errors. As a result, the final report is written in a unified style and reflects a high level of proficiency in English (C1 level). 
- **Open-Source:**
We plan to incorporate Open-Source solutions into our product to speed-up the development. For instance, some places where we might use it: frontend, time selection, telegram authentification.
- **Experts in relevant domains:**
In the current state of the project, we do not have any requirement to consult or involve external experts, apart from our Capstone project instructors.


## **Inviting Other Students**


- **How it all began**
From the outset of forming the team, we maintained an open mindset, welcoming any new members who could contribute to the successful implementation of our project. With this approach, we managed to assemble a team of five individuals. Together, we engaged in discussions to explore ideas that could simplify our daily lives. Once we settled on a project, each team member began offering their unique expertise and how they could contribute to the project's success based on their strengths. By taking into account our collective hard skills and effectively assigning tasks among ourselves, we are confident in our ability to execute a successful project and gain valuable experience.
- **Democracy**
As a team, we have established a decision-making process where we address major problems through team meetings. Our approach involves voting and reaching a majority consensus to determine the course of action.
We have already conducted two team meetings during which we developed and refined this project.
- **Totalitarianism**
Despite the aforementioned fact, based on our experience from previous courses like SWP, we recognize the importance of having a designated team leader. As of now, we have elected Dmitry Bannikov to fulfill this role.
The primary responsibility of the team leader is to add new tasks to the GitHub repository based on the decisions made during team meetings. Additionally, the team leader has the final say in resolving any local conflicts that may arise during the project implementation.
 
## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

### **Overview:**
Our project is an attempt to simplify the use of 'Попутчики Иннополис' telegram chat by making it more structured and available both for english- and russian- speaking users. Our vision is the easy-to-use website paired with easy-to-use telegram bot, both of which in collaboration make it easy to find fellow travellers.
The website lets you filter through already existing trip requests made by other users, respond to them, create your own, and more. The telegram bot gives you notifications and sometimes opportunity to make decisions through it.

### **Schematic Drawings:**

### **Tech Stack:**
For now, this is our preliminary outline of the tech stack we plan to use. Please note that it is subject to change, and we expect to finalize it by the end of next week:
- Backend: Go 
- Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB 
- Frontend: JavaScript + React 
- Telegram bot: Python 


### **Anticipating Future Problems:**
#### Communication and Coordination:
To overcome this problem we:
- created a group chat
- schedule regular team meetups 
We have already conducted two team meetups where we decided key aspects of our project and made important management decisions
- elect team leader

#### Limited Resources

We have a limited number of resources, with only 5 students who are also juggling other subjects and personal commitments. Additionally, we have a tight deadline of 7 weeks to complete the project.
To overcome this problem we:
- made important management decisions in the first week.
- will utilize all the acquired experience from past courses.
- plan to attend lectures to stay in touch with instructors.

### **Elaborate Explanations:**
#### Backend
Backend will have access to the database where information about the trips will be stored. It will also provide an API for both the Telegram bot and the frontend parts.
#### Frontend
Frontend will include a Telegram authentication page, which will help authorize users, preventing spammers and malicious actors, while also providing an easy way to contact other travelers.

The frontend will feature a main page with filtering options, allowing you to choose the time, destination, and other criteria. On this page, you can view all pending trip requests that match your filters. You can respond to existing requests or create your own.
#### Telegram bot
The Telegram bot will send you notifications regarding your request, whether you created it or responded to someone else's request. Additionally, it can serve as a convenient way to interact with the request. For example, you might receive a choice to join a driver who created a request.

**Feedback**  

**Value Proposition**
Good, stating for the value proposition. But it would be better if you wrote the solution. It’s ok to repeat it in another section

One drawback I see here, that not all travellers will welcome strangers. Beside groups that you mention have taxi driver deliver people. Maybe you should focus how can you incorporate them?

Use case is a bit weak. Try to think of more uses cases your solution will be used and by whom?

**Lean startup question**
- Very weak metric . Try to use NPS, Retention rate, visitors, number of users… etc try to google metrics to measure success in building products 

**AI** 
We mean here will utilise AI applications in your solution. 
Not what ai tools you used during development  

Vision Of The Project 
Good

**Overall**
Very good report! But try to think more about AI utilizing. 
And explain more on the use cases 
5/5

# **Week 2 - Choosing the Tech Stack, Designing the Architecture**


## **Tech Stack Resources**
Currently, we are not utilizing any project-based books for the implementation of our project. However, we have discovered a short book that caters specifically to beginner technical writers, aiming to improve the quality of our reports. The book is available at the following [link.](https://www.e-buc.com/portades/9788498803488_L33_23.pdf)


## **Mentorship Support**
Currently, we do not have an active mentor involved in our project. However, we are open to seeking a mentor in the later stages of our project. We believe that having a mentor would contribute to the success of our project by providing valuable guidance, experience, and insights. We understand that finding a mentor is our responsibility, and we are committed to actively seeking one to enhance our project's outcomes.

## **Exploring Alternative Resources**
- Tour of Go: We have utilized the Tour of Go, an interactive tutorial, to learn the Go programming language. It has been instrumental in building a strong foundation and understanding the core concepts of Go.
- Free Code Camp YouTube videos: We have found the Free Code Camp YouTube channel's videos to be valuable resources. These videos provide practical explanations and demonstrations that have helped us fill knowledge gaps and deepen our understanding of various aspects of our tech stack.
- Documentation: We have extensively relied on the official documentation of our tech stack. The documentation has been an invaluable resource, providing comprehensive explanations, usage examples, and references for specific functionalities, APIs, and best practices.

## **Identifying Knowledge Gaps**
- Report Writing:
    In order to address the importance of report writing in representing our progress to Capstone project instructors, we have implemented the following strategies:
    - Utilizing AI models to compensate for the lack of experience in creating effective reports.
    - Assigning an entry-level book, as mentioned earlier, to guide us in improving our report writing skills.
    - Seeking informative feedback from instructors to refine and enhance our report-writing process.
- Golang:
    To address the issue of a team member in the BackEnd team lacking experience with Golang, we have taken the following steps:
    - Utilizing the "A Tour of Go" project to familiarize the team member with the syntax and fundamentals of Golang.
    - Leveraging Free Code Camp videos to further deepen our understanding and knowledge of Golang.
    - Assigning a team member who is already familiar with Golang to provide support, answer questions, and offer assistance as needed.
    - Adjusting the workload to ensure that the team member can work on the code after their Backend teammate completes the initial skeleton. 

## **Engaging with the Tech Community**
While we understand the importance of engaging with the broader tech community, we have not actively sought guidance or learned from experienced professionals in our tech stack. At the current state of the project, we have not found it necessary to engage extensively with the tech community. However, we do have means to engage experts through professional networks if critical tech stack problems arise that require external expertise. We remain open to exploring online forums, groups, and attending local meetups in Kazan or Innopolis as the project progresses, should the need arise for further engagement with the tech community.

## **Learning Objectives**
Some of the problems we encountered and the methods we employed to resolve them were detailed in **Identifying Knowledge Gaps** section. In addition to those challenges, we are confident that we possess the necessary competences to commence development at this stage. The specific plan for our development process will be elaborated in the subsequent sections.

## **Sharing Knowledge with Peers**
We had two team meetings, and the reports from those meetings are provided below. Additionally, we maintained frequent communication within our small teams of two, allowing for detailed collaboration and knowledge sharing.

## **How have you leveraged AI to compensate for any lacking expertise in your tech stack?** 
Yes, we leveraged AI extensively. During the course of this week, we made use of AI and open-source solutions to test multiple implementations of different parts of our project. This allowed us to explore a range of potential solutions and evaluate their effectiveness. The integration of AI was particularly valuable in facilitating the evaluation and comparison process, empowering us to make well-informed decisions and select the most suitable tools for our project.

## **Weekly Progress Report**

During week 2, we as a team made 2 team meetings: 

### **Team meeting 1**
During our team meeting, we made the decision to divide into smaller teams of two people, each responsible for a specific part of our project. This approach proved to be highly efficient in terms of communication and knowledge sharing. By working closely with a designated team member, we were able to focus on our assigned tasks and share our expertise more effectively. Any questions that arose during the meeting were thoroughly discussed and addressed. In cases where additional questions emerged between meetings, we directed them to our team leader, who promptly resolved them. This division of responsibilities and streamlined communication process has contributed to our project's progress and overall productivity.
