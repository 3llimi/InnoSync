### **Value Proposition**

- **Identify the Problem:**
Our beloved city, Innopolis, is situated at a distance from Kazan city. While this location offers numerous benefits, such as beautiful natural surroundings and a tight-knit community, it presents a challenge when it comes to traveling to places of interest like the airport or Kazan itself. Despite the availability of public transportation, citizens often encounter transportation issues. Our project aims to address this problem and provide a solution.

- **Solution Description:**
Can be found below in the **Defining the Vision for Your Project** section




- **Benefits to Users:**
The main benefit of our project is the opportunity for users to save money on transportation costs. Additionally, our project will provide a convenient and reliable means of transportation, particularly for routes that may have limited public transportation options.
Furthermore, we believe that our project will foster social connections and community building. By providing an easy way to find travel companions, we envision the potential for friendships to form and even new startup opportunities to arise.

- **Differentiation:**
Our main differentiating factor from other existing solutions is our ability to leverage Innopolis's strong sense of community. With our project, users not only reduce costs but also find compatible travel companions.
The current local solutions, such as the 'Иннополис попутчики' and 'Taxi иннополис' Telegram groups, have significant drawbacks. The messages in these groups are exclusively in Russian, making them inaccessible to some citizens of Innopolis. Furthermore, in our focus group session, the majority of respondents who use those groups (18 out of 20 people) expressed their dissatisfaction, highlighting the groups' current state as unusable.

- **Testimonials or Use Cases:**
Use case: 
There are several citizens in Innopolis who want to travel from Kazan airport to Innopolis and would be interested in sharing a ride. However, they are unaware of each other or available drivers in our community.
Our project aims to connect these individuals with each other and with drivers in our community. By facilitating communication and coordination, we will help them find suitable travel companions and arrange shared rides.


## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

1. **What problem or need does your software project address?**
    - Our project will address the challenge of finding travel companions for trips between specific locations within specified timeframes. It will provide a solution for both types of travelers: those who are seeking a ride and those who are willing to offer one.
2. **Who are your target users or customers?**
    - Innopolis citizens
3. **How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?**
    - To develop the MVP of our project, we conducted a focus group and analyzed the shortcomings of existing solutions. Following the MVP phase, we will incorporate user feedback and make necessary improvements.
4. **What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?**
    - We will monitor the number of users and gather their feedback.
5. **How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?** 
    - As mentioned earlier, we will collect user feedback after the release of the MVP.
    - We will analyze the feedback to identify the most critical and impactful issues.
    - During a meetup, we will establish specific integration goals.
    - Our team leader will add the corresponding task to the git repository.
    - A team member will assign the task to themselves and proceed with its implementation.
    - Thorough testing will be performed to ensure the quality of the feature.
    - Once testing is complete, we will deploy the feature.
    - We will then return to step 1 and repeat the feedback-gathering process.


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

- **AI (Artificial Intelligence):**
In the current state of implementing the MVP of the project, we envision utilizing AI in the following ways:
    1. For team members who have a tech stack not directly related to the project (e.g., C#), tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can be immensely helpful in bridging the syntactical differences between programming languages.
    2. Certain blocks of code or functions can be generated entirely using AI. This has the potential to expedite the development process and increase efficiency.
    3. Every week, we are assigned the task of writing a significant report. Initially, we tried to work on it as a group, but we soon realized that this approach was inefficient. We found ourselves repeating information, and the report lacked proper structure and consistency.
    To overcome this issue we assigned technical writer (Ayaz Safin).
    During the writing process, I utilized a template provided by our Capstone project instructors to maintain a consistent flow of information. Additionally, I used ChatGPT to review and revise each section, ensuring accuracy and minimizing spelling errors. As a result, the final report is written in a unified style and reflects a high level of proficiency in English (C1 level). 
- **Open-Source:**
We plan to incorporate Open-Source solutions into our product to speed-up the development. For instance, some places where we might use it: frontend, time selection, telegram authentification.
- **Experts in relevant domains:**
In the current state of the project, we do not have any requirement to consult or involve external experts, apart from our Capstone project instructors.


## **Inviting Other Students**


- **How it all began**
From the outset of forming the team, we maintained an open mindset, welcoming any new members who could contribute to the successful implementation of our project. With this approach, we managed to assemble a team of five individuals. Together, we engaged in discussions to explore ideas that could simplify our daily lives. Once we settled on a project, each team member began offering their unique expertise and how they could contribute to the project's success based on their strengths. By taking into account our collective hard skills and effectively assigning tasks among ourselves, we are confident in our ability to execute a successful project and gain valuable experience.
- **Democracy**
As a team, we have established a decision-making process where we address major problems through team meetings. Our approach involves voting and reaching a majority consensus to determine the course of action.
We have already conducted two team meetings during which we developed and refined this project.
- **Totalitarianism**
Despite the aforementioned fact, based on our experience from previous courses like SWP, we recognize the importance of having a designated team leader. As of now, we have elected Dmitry Bannikov to fulfill this role.
The primary responsibility of the team leader is to add new tasks to the GitHub repository based on the decisions made during team meetings. Additionally, the team leader has the final say in resolving any local conflicts that may arise during the project implementation.
 
## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

### **Overview:**
Our project is an attempt to simplify the use of 'Попутчики Иннополис' telegram chat by making it more structured and available both for english- and russian- speaking users. Our vision is the easy-to-use website paired with easy-to-use telegram bot, both of which in collaboration make it easy to find fellow travellers.
The website lets you filter through already existing trip requests made by other users, respond to them, create your own, and more. The telegram bot gives you notifications and sometimes opportunity to make decisions through it.

### **Tech Stack:**
For now, this is our preliminary outline of the tech stack we plan to use. Please note that it is subject to change, and we expect to finalize it by the end of next week:
- Backend: Go 
- Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB 
- Frontend: JavaScript + React 
- Telegram bot: Python 


### **Anticipating Future Problems:**
#### Communication and Coordination:
To overcome this problem we:
- created a group chat
- schedule regular team meetups 
We have already conducted two team meetups where we decided key aspects of our project and made important management decisions
- elect team leader

#### Limited Resources

We have a limited number of resources, with only 5 students who are also juggling other subjects and personal commitments. Additionally, we have a tight deadline of 7 weeks to complete the project.
To overcome this problem we:
- made important management decisions in the first week.
- will utilize all the acquired experience from past courses.
- plan to attend lectures to stay in touch with instructors.

### **Elaborate Explanations:**
#### Backend
Backend will have access to the database where information about the trips will be stored. It will also provide an API for both the Telegram bot and the frontend parts.
#### Frontend
Frontend will include a Telegram authentication page, which will help authorize users, preventing spammers and malicious actors, while also providing an easy way to contact other travelers.

The frontend will feature a main page with filtering options, allowing you to choose the time, destination, and other criteria. On this page, you can view all pending trip requests that match your filters. You can respond to existing requests or create your own.
#### Telegram bot
The Telegram bot will send you notifications regarding your request, whether you created it or responded to someone else's request. Additionally, it can serve as a convenient way to interact with the request. For example, you might receive a choice to join a driver who created a request.
