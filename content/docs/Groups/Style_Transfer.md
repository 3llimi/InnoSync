### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
Our project helps people who want to make their pictures look like paintings or have a different artistic style. Before our project, it was difficult and time-consuming to do this manually or without any art knowledge.

- Solution Description:
Our project makes it easy for anyone to change the style of their pictures using a simple computer program. You just need to choose the style you like, and our program will automatically apply it to your picture. It's fast, user-friendly, and doesn't require any special skills.

- Benefits to Users:
Our software project saves users time by quickly transforming the style of their pictures without needing any art skills. It also allows users to explore different creative options, saves costs by avoiding hiring professionals, enhances the visual appeal of their images, and can be used in various fields like art, design, and social media.

- Differentiation:
By offering a user-friendly interface, a diverse style library, high-quality results, efficiency, and broad applications.

- User Impact:
Our software project has a positive impact on users' creativity, workflows, and the broader society. It fosters artistic expression, drives innovation, advances industry practices, and contributes to the preservation and appreciation of diverse artistic styles and cultural heritage.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
They illustrate how users can benefit from the time savings, enhanced visual appeal, and increased creative possibilities offered by our software project.


## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean startup methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address?
2. Who are your target users or customers?
3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?
4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?

### Answers: 

1. Our software project addresses the need for an efficient and accessible solution for style transfer, allowing users to easily apply artistic styles to their images without the need for manual editing or artistic expertise.

2. Our target users or customers include individuals and professionals in various domains such as digital art, graphic design, advertising, and social media. We aim to cater to users who want to enhance the visual appeal of their images by incorporating different artistic styles.

3. To validate and test our assumptions about the project, we will engage in user testing and gather feedback from our target users. We will conduct surveys, interviews, and usability tests to understand their needs, pain points, and preferences. This feedback will help us refine and improve our software project.

4. The success of our project will be measured using several metrics, including user engagement metrics such as the number of active users, frequency of usage, and user satisfaction ratings. We will also consider the conversion rate of free trial users to paying customers, as well as any positive impact on the users' creative output and productivity.

5. Based on user feedback, we will iterate and pivot if necessary to address any identified pain points or areas for improvement. We will closely analyze user feedback and data, identify patterns or common requests, and prioritize the most impactful changes. This iterative approach will allow us to continuously refine our software project, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of our users. If necessary, we are open to pivoting our project direction to better align with user preferences and market demands.


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Explain how your team plans to leverage the following resources for the development and success of your project:

Unfortunately, this report was poorly formatted and I had to reformat most of the text. The weekly tasks are there to give you the general structure - there is no need to copy all the text. Also, consider using the guide here -  https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. The project page do not describe much other than saying that you will do style transfer (which is already solved problem in machine learning). Please, provide more detailed view of your project, outline your group contribution on top of available ML solutions and how are you planing to do that. Will it be a web app and a telegram bot?
