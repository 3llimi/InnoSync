# BudgetAI

Our team studies the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of large language models (LLM).
We plan to take an existing language model as a base and fine-tune it using LoRA for
a programming-related downstream task.

# Week 1

## Team Formation and Project Proposal

### Team Members

Please list the names and contact details (Telegram and email) of your team members:

| Team Member | Telegram alias | Email Address |

### Value Proposition

The topic of the project we are working on is application of LoRA in LLMs. I will leave
aside the discussion of importance of LLMs themselves and the benefits they give to
users. The goal of our project is to apply the LoRA algorithm to fine-tune already
existing language models for a specific downstream task. The use of LoRA allows for
more computationally- and memory-efficient model adaptation, compared to
the conventional means of language model fine-tuning, which still gives approximately
as good (sometimes even better) results.

## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

Our project relies on all the aforementioned resources heavily.

The single target outcome of our project is a machine learning model, so the whole work
is AI-centric.

We are going to use a publicly available and open-source-licensed language
model as a base and, most likely, train it on publicly available data. Even the key
algorithm we are using is a (publicly available) scientific article backed by a
corresponding open-source implementation.

Finally, we stay in close contact with our mentors who target us in terms of
supplementary materials and the roadmap of the project.

## Inviting Other Students

We already have a first-year bachelor studnet named Hadi Salloum working with our team
on this project. _Perhaps_, we could welcome more students in the team, on the other
hand, the current team size is probably optimal for the task we have chosen.

## Defining the Vision for Your Project

A complete, clear, and compelling vision is something that might not be the strongest
trait of us as a team because, as the first two weeks of our work have shown, we do not
have a wholesome vision of the goal we are going towards. We mitigate this by working
closely with our project's mentor, which also helps us to extend and deepen our vision.
