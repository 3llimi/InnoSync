[Your answers on leveraging AI, open-source, and experts here]


## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

A clear and compelling vision is crucial for successful project planning. When you have a well-defined concept and a shared vision of what you aim to achieve, executing on that vision becomes significantly easier. Therefore, after thorough discussions and settling on a promising idea, it is essential to craft a comprehensive vision with your team. This vision should be detailed, encompassing your chosen tech stack, and anticipate potential future challenges. Below, describe your project using schematic drawings and provide elaborate explanations of all significant components.

- Overview:
Try this is a mobile app that revolutionizes personal style. It offers tailored outfit recommendations. By simplifying fashion decisions and suggesting relevant items for purchase, it saves time and boosts confidence in personal style choices. With Try this, users can enhance their fashion sense and unlock their true style potential.

- [Schematic Drawings](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOvDPkno=/?share_link_id=373993742957)

- Tech Stack:
Python (openCV, PyTorch) for ML and CV part (recommendations and try-on)
Flask for backend - choice is based on team member's expirience
Flutter for frontend - choice is based on team members' expirience

- Anticipating Future Problems:
The problems may arise with virtual try-on for example it is a challenging task to segment the clothes from a picture, restore the background and pull a new piece of clothing. If so, then we will ask help from an expert and try to integrate solution into our service.

- Elaborate Explanations:
Core features: outfit analysis, recommendation and try-on.
1. Outfit analysis - rule-based model with style rules (rules are already formulated)
2. Recommendation - depends on previous step (the same algorithm)
3. Try-on - CV model for segmentation and object detection.

# **Week #2**
### **Tech Stack Selection**
Python (openCV, PyTorch) for ML and CV part (recommendations and try-on)
Flask for backend - choice is based on team member's expirience
Flutter for frontend - choice is based on team members' expirience
### **Architecture Design**
1. **Component Breakdown**: we decided to break the project into following modules: backend, frontend, ml.
  Frontend is responsible for visual representation.
  Backend is responsible for linking frontend with ml and also manages databases.
  ML module is used for imlementing key features of the app (recommendations, try-on, outfit analysis).  
3. **Data Management**: Data will be stored in databases: MongoDB for short-term data (sessional data) and PostgreSQL for permanent data (users history).
4. **User Interface (UI) Design**:  [design sketch](https://www.figma.com/proto/YOeV2ORkvcHW8iEjb6aaiF/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD?type=design&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=249%3A461&show-proto-sidebar=1&node-id=249-502&mode=design)
5. **Integration and APIs**:  We decided to make a standard request body for the API, which will always contain two fields: payload and message. First of all, the developer will take a look on the status code of the response, to find out, if it was performed successfully, or not. In case of any errors (for example, 400 ‘Bad request’), there will be an informative explanation in the message field of what exactly went wrong. If everything is fine, the developer will get a payload, which is strictly standardized according to the Swagger API. The backend API will have two internal services: machine learning (ML) and databases (DB). ML service will be responsible for communication with the ML project, while DB service will provide methods to encapsulate logic to access database. Each service is called at the endpoint handler. To deploy the backend we will use docker-compose, which will combine everything together.
6. **Scalability and Performance**: We are committed to anticipating future growth and ensuring scalability in terms of computing power and throughput. We will rent several servers and increase pods in kubernetes to increase capacity and accommodate higher user loads and data volumes without compromising performance.
7. **Security and Privacy**: We prioritize the security of user data and will incorporate measures into our architecture. This includes implementing authentication, authorization, encryption, and other relevant security practices. We will ensure that data is protected through protocols like HTTPS and adhere to careful storage and data access policies to safeguard against vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.
8. **Error Handling and Resilience**:  Our strategies include implementing error logging mechanisms, continuous monitoring, and establishing graceful error recovery processes. To prevent errors, we employ server-side validations, conduct testing, and monitor the application's performance.
9. **Deployment and DevOps**: Deploy will be done using Docker through kubernetes. 

**Answering questioner**
1) Tech Stack Resources. We are not using any project-based books, we believe that it is redundant for our project. All needed information is specified in documentation or scientific acticles. We enhace our knoweledge through overcoming difficulties in realization process using websites, best practices and acticles.
2) Mentorship Support. We have a person that is ready to help us but for now we did not need any external help.
3) Exploring Alternative Resources. We lack knoweledge in ML and CV part of our project. So we found some interesting libraries and tutorial to address problems:
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmfashion            https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/clip/blob/master/notebooks/Interacting_with_CLIP.ipynb#scrollTo=NSSrLY185jSf&line=10&uniqifier=1
https://github.com/levindabhi/cloth-segmentation
https://github.com/minar09/cp-vton-plus
4) Identifying Knowledge Gaps. 
  ML: Anvar Iskhakov, Karim Galliamov, Konstantin Fedorov
  Frontend: Yan Kozyrenko, Kamil Almetov
  Backed: Anatoly Pushkarev, Alsu Abdulmanova
  We lack expertise in ML and CV, so we search for tutorial and best practices to fill the gaps.
5) Engaging with the Tech Community. Some members of the team attend meetups organized in Innopolis.
6) Learning Objectives. We did not set specific learning objectives. Our goal is to make functional product. Every week we make progress and if any problems occur we solve it. That is how we learn. 
7) Sharing Knowledge with Peers. Every 3-4 days each development department gathers for discussion. We share knoweledge if problem occurs or search for solution all together.
8) We used ChatGPT but only to accelerate development process (not to write simple code ourselves).

# **Week #3**
**Prototype Features**
What we have already done:

Frontend:
1) Formulated message contracts with backend for inital photo and answer with identified items.
2) First and second screens UI are made.
![Screens](https://github.com/IU-PR/Capstone_project/assets/92600316/9cef6092-07e3-4c06-967f-7ce3c7a8a122)
3) Functionatity and UI of third screen (UI, data-layer; API interaction - in progress)
4) Authorization made through Firebase for Google Account
   
Backend:
1) User data storage (in testing)
2) Wrap app with Docker (in testing)

ML:
1) Identified pieces of clothes for detection
2) Unified overlaping masks
3) Classigication, object detection, segmentation through HaggingFace pre-trained model
4) Exctraction of color from picture
5) Identify colors and map to Itten Circle
6) Clastering clothing with style


**User Interface**
[Use-case user flows link](https://www.figma.com/proto/YOeV2ORkvcHW8iEjb6aaiF/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD?type=design&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=249%3A461&show-proto-sidebar=1&node-id=249-502&mode=design)
User starts with authorization, they can do it through Apple ID, Google account, Yandex ID and VK. Then user selects its gender and uploads photo of the outfit. Further, user selects goal of the outfit from given options (precise enough to make conclusion about style of the event: official, casual, semi-official, etc.). Then the user sees their picture with highlited items and the color defines the suitability of clothes (red - not suitable, yellow - could be better, green - okay). After that user can choose which item it wants to change and sees scrollable options from marketplaces. User can select any item and see how it looks on him/her/it.
All in all, we identify following steps of user flow:
1) Authorization
2) Gender
3) Outfit selection
4) Purpose
5) Analysis
6) Recommendation
7) Try-on

**Challenges and Solutions**: Example: SAM mmodel gave masks with bad quality (it sometimes did not identify all parts of person and there were duplicates in masks). To solve this problem we found 2 solutions. First, delete duplicates with biggest intersection over union but this did not work with several photos. Second, we replced combination of SAM+FashionClip with pre-trained SegFormer model, this solution works good.

**Next Steps**:
1) Authorization for other services (highlited above)
2) Save email address of user
3) Finish backed testing and identify problems
4) Fix backend problems (scheduled later)
5) Integrate ML with backend
6) Test ML segmentation with complex pictures to identify problems, fix if necessary
7) Develop interface that accepts photo and mask, returns list of [color, color in Itten Circle]
8) Fine-tune clothes clasterisation
9) Rule-based model for a color scheme

# **Week #4**

## **External feedback on our project** ##
We have conducted several interviews among Innopolis students and collected a comprehensive feeback about work. Here are the main points, which we got:

### **Negative points** ###
1) On the screen, where user should upload a photo, which will be used to process clothes ([link to component in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YOeV2ORkvcHW8iEjb6aaiF/%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD?type=design&node-id=398-132&mode=design&t=7zhF25fkWNhV2YsY-4)) it is completely not understandable about photo type - how should I pose, which formats are allowed, should the person fit the frame entirely etc. We realized, that we should add more details about it.
2) Under the hood we use a complex system of rules to estimate the photo and suggest new items. User is not familiar with them. It was suggested to add a guide, how everything is evaluated, because now, from the user perspective, it looks completely random. It is also a good idea to provide a guide, where user can learn, why he is not looking his best.
3) It was suggested to add gamification to display, how good the look is overal. Because now we have two kinds of feedback: is it looking good or is it looking bad.
4) It is also suggested to add a feature, which will provide an ability to store the results of look processing. For example, a person uploads an image, the system provides some suggestions (e.g other pair of shoes), the person saves it and then tries them in a shop.

### **Positive points** ###
1) It is useful, that we provide an ability to log in using popular services - Google, Yandex, Apple and VK
2) Overal, the UI is intuitive is straight

## **Testing** ##
**Machine Learning part**<br>
It is essential to do proper research and testing in this sphere, because there are a lot of options regarding models, their parameters and architectures. Also it is very important to keep in mind processing time: we do not want our system to process images for hours.

Biggest insights are the following. For embeddings testing we have manually collected a dataset of different clothes. After research and testing with this dataset we found out that embeddings noticed clothing type more than style. This resulted in using not standard KNN <br>

Clustering (k-means, fuzzy c-means) performed bad. Also we have tested different distances with this models and found out that cosine distance was worse that euclidian one.

**Backend part**<br>
We have already started to connect our services between each other (Frontend, Backend & DB and ML). This resulted in a lot of errors and misunderstandings in terms of contracts and expected outputs. After some real using we are still facing a lot of errors and unexpected behaviour. Then this changes are rapidly fixed and testing process repeats.

**Frontend part**<br>
We often test our app through ordinary using its key features, opening and clicking everything. This allows to find unexpected behaviour and bugs. Also we try to use the app with some unsual screens and this often results in unexpected interface building.

## **Iteration** ##

We have weekly meetings with the team members, where we all together track all the progress, discuss all issues and progress and assign new tasks. These meetings allows to look on other sphere developers progress and issues from non-developer perspective. There we often find some problems and holes in logic and flow of our services.

**Machine Learning part**<br>

We looked at the testing results and decided to change unlabeled segmentation with labeling with CLIP to SegFormer. Also it is very hard to find a model with a proper license for our use, so sometimes we have to use lower quality models.<br>

Also there are changes in terms of labeling of clothes: firstly we were trying to generate as more labels as we could, but later decided to reduce the amount of classes. For example, instead of T-shirt, jacket and etc we decided to use just upper clothes.

**Backend part**<br>

Here we have a true iterative process, because we often find a lot of bottlenecks in the code or achirecture and modify it to make our system more scalable and stable. <br>

Talking abour logical part, we have added one more route to create a new session by sending user credentials, instead of combining it with image sending.

**Frontend part**<br>

There are a lot of work regarding changes of routes, data and architecture of backend, as it was stated above. Also often we implement some design, use it and then realize that it is not good. It results in recreating and modificating prototypes and UI.

**Feedback**  

**External Feedback**<br>
Good that you have a feedback from customers.

**Testing**<br>
Ok good, you make all of this testing, Where is the proof?

**Iteration**<br>
This is not iteration plan.
How will you adapt to what the customer is requesting?


> Here we have a true iterative process

How? Show us how it’s a true iterative process

An iteration plan, is essentially the plan for an upcoming iteration. It would typically outline:
* The goals and objectives for the iteration: what the team aims to achieve.
* The features to be developed
* The tasks needed to develop these features: this might include coding, testing, design tasks, etc.
* Any assumptions or dependencies.
* A timeline for the iteration



**Overall**<br>
The report is ok, you need to reflect on what is requested an do it properly

# **Week #5**

Last week, our team conducted solution interviews to gather feedback and insights from users. These interviews allowed us to understand their needs, preferences, and pain points related to our solution. However, we recognized the need to streamline and scale this feedback collection process. So, to address this issue we launched a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/u8F91wtgtUudewhQ9). It is important to note that it does not provide statistical analysis or quantitative metrics. Instead, we focused on analyzing the responses to identify common themes, patterns, and recurring issues raised by users. 

Here are the insights:
1. Most people believe that we covered all features that were announced
2. Add more options for outfit circumstances
3. User flow is intuitive but outfit estimation is not clear. So, we are going to add instructions at the beginning

These were the most frequent comments, so it is only fair to address those issues first.


As part of our user research efforts, we recently launched a [Google Form](https://forms.gle/G2fC2ooNTiunbkr89) aimed at collecting a database of individuals who experience challenges with styling and fashion choices. The form was designed to identify potential users who would be interested in being the first adopters of our MVP.

This engaged group of individuals will play a crucial role in shaping the direction and success of our product. Their experiences and feedback will guide us in tailoring our solution to meet their specific needs and deliver a more effective and user-centered experience.

Based on the statistics gathered from our Google Form, we have confirmed the target audience for our solution. The data revealed that 53.1% of respondents fall within the age range of 18-25, indicating strong interest from young people. Additionally, 68.8% of respondents identified as women, suggesting a significant preference for our solution among this demographic.

These insights validate our initial assumptions about the target audience and highlight the potential demand for our product among young individuals, particularly women. Understanding the specific demographics that are most interested in our solution allows us to tailor our marketing and product development strategies accordingly. 

The main challenges that people face with choosing clothes:
1. Spending too much time trying clothes on
2. Cannot create color matching outfits effectively
3. Too little clothes range (monotony)
