# **About us**

_PipeVision_ is a project which aims to develop an automated pipeline marking recognition system based on a neural network.

</p>
 The system addresses the challenge of manual pipeline and metal marking recognition, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Our solution provides accurate recognition, improving the pipeline construction and maintenance industry.

Our client is Gazstroyprom, company that performs a full range of works within projects for the production, processing and transportation of natural gas. They approached us with the problem they faced during metal marking recognition, and suggested to solve it.

If you have any suggestions or want to dive deeper into our project, you can contact Anastasia Barabanova at [telegram](https://t.me/a_n_a_s_t_a_s_i_a10)
