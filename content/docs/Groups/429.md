## Auto-ML helper for marketing specialists
(project name is in progress)

## Value Proposition
Marketers often need to use machine learning models to evaluate sales, conversions, and business development. However, for these generally simple tasks, it is necessary to have a machine learning specialist. We offer a website that automatically processes incoming data in the most efficient way and allows you to use previously prepared bundles of model + preprocessing to process new data. The difference from the existing Auto ML solutions is that the existing ones are used for too wide a range of tasks and are too general to work effectively or require specialized knowledge.

## Lean Startup Questionnaire

Marketers sometimes need data research in their work and either a separate employee or knowledge is needed for this. Our solution will allow us to conduct such research without attracting additional resources, since our solution will be understandable and automated. To determine the needs and tasks, we have scheduled interviews with SEZ marketers. Depending on their experience, we will adapt the product.

## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

Our project will be based on machine learning models to automate the user's task. The AI will select the necessary hyperparameters depending on the data entered by the user. For the validity of our solution, we will consider the functionality of existing projects and identify their weaknesses. And we will also use ready-made libraries for basic machine learning. To consult with the implementation of our project, we contacted a person working in the industry. We received advice, criticism and recommendations from him. And we will continue to cooperate with him to improve the project.

## Defining the Vision for Your Project

Marketers often need to use machine learning models to evaluate sales, conversions, and business development. However, for these generally simple tasks, it is necessary to have a machine learning specialist. We offer a website that automatically processes incoming data in the most efficient way and allows you to use previously prepared bundles of model + preprocessing to process new data. The difference from the existing Auto ML solutions is that the existing ones are used for too wide a range of tasks and are too general to work effectively or require specialized knowledge.

As the project grows, we will have to switch to a fundamentally different architecture, since the current one assumes a search of hyperparameters optimized using the optima library (where hyperparameters are all stages of preprocessing, and the machine learning model, and its hyperparameters).  This is enough for now, but after the completion of the work within the capstone project, one of the more complex schemes will be used.
