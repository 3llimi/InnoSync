# **LogiFlex - get more, using AI**

# **Introduction**

LogiFlex is a logistics project created to optimize space during cargo transportation.

(the logo will appear here soon)

The idea of the project turned out to be so successful that immediately after the first one, the project team managed to agree and attract investments from interested investors.

9 days later, in three days, the head of the Logoflex project managed to negotiate with the largest network of building materials in the Far East for further payment for the development process, delivery of the project and obtaining copyrights for it to solve its own logistical problems and optimize transport processes.

## **Week1**

During this week, our main tasks were to form our team and select the appropriate project.

### **Team Formation**

Our team was selected based on the experience of previous years, participation and wins in international Olympiads, competitions, and hackathons. If necessary, an offer was sent to the general student group with the search for the position we need in the project. During the day, we managed to find the missing team member and smoothly start working.

### **Value Proposition**

The flagship project of the LogiFlex team solves the problem of cargo distribution in a limited space, so that it meets the criteria of optimality of customers.

Thus, the project solves several problems in the field of logistics and optimal cargo transportation, which do not have a reference solution to this day.

The benefit for the customer is the speed of obtaining information about the location of the goods in an arbitrary vehicle, as well as its price. At the moment, the company has a department consisting of 4+ logisticians, who place the corresponding goods in different trucks. All processes take place manually, which takes a lot of time and finances (computing power, time for processing data by people, and the salary that the department receives).

Our project minimizes the costs of the company and allows you to replace an entire part of the specialized department with one programmer / logistician who will monitor the correctness of the algorithm.

   * Regularly gather feedback from customers through surveys, user interviews, and support channels to understand their needs and pain points.
   * Prioritize and analyze feedback to identify areas of improvement and address any issues or shortcomings in the software.
   * Continuously release updates and new features based on customer feedback and evolving market demands.
   * Conduct A/B testing or controlled experiments to test different approaches or variations of the software to optimize performance and user satisfaction.
   * Stay agile and flexible in adapting the software based on user feedback, market trends, and emerging technologies to ensure the solution remains relevant and competitive.

### **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

From the existing numerous variety of different types of building materials at the customer (the nomenclature has more than 10,000 different types of goods), it is difficult to use the standard algorithm for the arrangement of goods in the truck, since each product has its own level of interaction of goods with each (for example, the program should take into account that you can not put a bag of cement on the sink, foam materials must have special storage conditions, and floor coverings are transported in the form of a roll), it was accepted jointly with the project customer to use Machine Learning and AAI methods to solve this problem by learning from the assembled and marked-up dataset.

The product development team will study an article to solve this problem in logistical ways, for example, about the use of ginetchisekih algorithms or about the use of training with a sub-training (more details about the subject of research will be discussed in the following weeks)

Having agreed with the customer, a twofold podderka was adopted to help build the dataset, resolve controversial (conflicting) issues during the solution. By agreement, we have at our disposal online communication during the working day from the Head of IT company, computing resources for AI algorithms and partially assembled datasets (resources for their assembly: movers, the driver of cargo vehicles and the staff of the current logistics department)

### **Inviting Other Students**

Our team consists of 4 second-year students of Innopolis University (The number of team members is agreed with Rustam Lukmanov). If necessary or showing interest in the project, we are considering attracting other students who can help to earn money (perhaps for some salary).

### **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

The vision of LogiFlex is to revolutionize cargo distribution in limited spaces by leveraging advanced algorithms and technology. Our flagship project aims to solve multiple challenges in logistics and optimize cargo transportation, providing customers with optimal solutions that have not been available before. By streamlining processes and reducing manual intervention, our project will significantly minimize costs for the company and deliver faster and more accurate information about the location and pricing of goods to our customers.

Problem and Need:

 - The existing cargo distribution process at LogiFlex involves manual placement of goods in trucks by a department consisting of logisticians. This process is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and prone to errors. By introducing automation and optimization, we aim to address these challenges and eliminate the need for a large specialized department. Our project will optimize cargo distribution in limited spaces, ensuring optimal solutions that meet customer criteria while reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Benefits and Impact:
 - Speed and Accuracy: Customers will experience faster and more reliable information about the location of their goods and the associated pricing. This will enable them to make informed decisions and plan their operations efficiently.
 - Cost Reduction: By automating the cargo distribution process, we will minimize costs for the company. This includes reducing computing power requirements, eliminating the need for a large team of logisticians, and streamlining data processing. These cost savings will be passed on to the customers, making LogiFlex a more competitive and cost-effective logistic provider.
 - Operational Efficiency: Our project will streamline the entire cargo distribution process, leading to improved operational efficiency. By replacing manual processes with algorithms, we will eliminate human errors and reduce the time required for data processing and decision-making. This will enable LogiFlex to handle a larger volume of cargo, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall service quality.

Tech Stack:

 - Programming Language: Python. Python is a versatile and widely adopted language with extensive libraries and frameworks for data processing and algorithm development. Also, we need a programming language to visualize data and get a final PDF file in the form of a snapshot of the location of goods.
 - Algorithmic Framework: Machine Learning (ML) and Optimization Algorithms. We will utilize machine learning techniques to develop models that can learn from historical data and make predictions about cargo distribution in limited spaces. Optimization algorithms will be employed to find optimal solutions based on customer criteria and resource constraints.
 - Infrastructure: Cloud Computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure). Utilizing cloud computing services will offer scalability, high availability, and cost-effective infrastructure for hosting and running the system. The choice of cloud provider will depend on factors such as cost, performance, and team familiarity.

Anticipating Future Problems:
 - Data Availability: Obtaining accurate and comprehensive data for training the machine learning models might be challenging. To mitigate this, we will establish partnerships with relevant stakeholders.
 - Algorithm Optimization: Developing efficient and accurate optimization algorithms can be complex. We will allocate sufficient time for algorithm design, implementation, and rigorous testing. Additionally, we will leverage existing research and collaborate with experts in the field to ensure optimal performance.

Elaborate Explanations:
 - Data Collection and Processing: We will gather historical data on cargo distribution, including customer criteria, available vehicles, and space constraints. This data will be processed and transformed into a suitable format for training the machine learning models.
 - Machine Learning Models: We will develop machine learning models that can learn from historical data to predict optimal cargo distribution based on customer criteria and space constraints.
 - Optimization Algorithms: Based on the predictions from the machine learning models, optimization algorithms will be employed to find the most optimal distribution of cargo across available vehicles while adhering to space constraints. These algorithms will consider factors such as cargo volume, weight, fragility, and customer priorities.

Our solution differentiates itself by integrating machine learning and optimization algorithms to provide optimal cargo distribution solutions in limited spaces. The combination of predictive analytics, optimization, and automation will offer significant advantages over traditional manual processes, resulting in cost savings, faster information retrieval, and improved overall efficiency in cargo transportation.
