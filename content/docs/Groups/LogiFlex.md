### Value Proposition

The flagship project of the LogiFlex team aims to solve the problem of cargo distribution in limited space, ensuring optimal solutions for customers. It tackles multiple challenges in the field of logistics and cargo transportation that lack definitive solutions to date.

The customer benefits from the project by obtaining real-time information about the location and pricing of goods in any vehicle. Currently, the company employs a team of four or more logisticians responsible for manually placing goods in different trucks. This process is time-consuming and costly, involving computational resources, manual data processing, and the salaries of the logistics department.

Our project minimizes the company's costs by replacing a significant part of the specialized department with a single programmer/logistician who monitors the algorithm's correctness.

### Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

Due to the wide variety of building materials available (with more than 10,000 different types of goods), using a standard algorithm for arranging goods in a truck becomes challenging. Each product has its own interaction requirements (e.g., a bag of cement cannot be placed on a sink, foam materials require special storage conditions, and floor coverings are transported in the form of rolls). To address this complexity, the LogiFlex team, in collaboration with the project customer, decided to employ Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to learn from a curated dataset and solve this problem.

The product development team will study articles related to logistical problem-solving, such as the use of genetic algorithms or sub-training techniques (more details to be discussed in the following weeks).

In collaboration with the customer, we have established twofold support, including building the dataset and resolving any conflicting issues during the solution. We have online communication access during working hours with the Head of the IT company, computing resources for AI algorithms, and partially assembled datasets (additional resources provided by movers, cargo vehicle drivers, and the current logistics department staff).

### Inviting Other Students

Our team currently consists of four second-year bachelor students from Innopolis University (The number of team members is agreed upon with Rustam Lukmanov). If required or if other students show interest in the project, we are open to involving them and providing compensation (possibly in the form of a salary). For example, Artem Batalov, a third-year bachelor student of Innopolis University, was involved in creating a LogiFlex business card site, as a DevOps specialist.

### Defining the Vision for Your Project

- Algorithm Optimization: Developing efficient and accurate optimization algorithms can be complex. We will allocate sufficient time for algorithm design, implementation, and rigorous testing. Additionally, we will leverage existing research and collaborate with experts in the field to ensure optimal performance.

#### Elaborate Explanations:

- Data Collection and Processing: We will gather historical data on cargo distribution, including customer criteria, available vehicles, and space constraints. This data will be processed and transformed into a suitable format for training the machine learning models.
- Machine Learning Models: We will develop machine learning models that can learn from historical data to predict optimal cargo distribution based on customer criteria and space constraints.
- Optimization Algorithms: Based on the predictions from the machine learning models, optimization algorithms will be employed to find the most optimal distribution of cargo across available vehicles while adhering to space constraints. These algorithms will consider factors such as cargo volume, weight, fragility, and customer priorities.

Our solution differentiates itself by integrating machine learning and optimization algorithms to provide optimal cargo distribution solutions in limited spaces. The combination of predictive analytics, optimization, and automation will offer significant advantages over traditional manual processes, resulting in cost savings, faster information retrieval, and improved overall efficiency in cargo transportation.
