### **Value Proposition**

- Identifying the Problem:
While tools like leetcode allows people to prepare for test questions in job interviews, candidates still do not know the whole process of the interview and lack the experience of a real interview. They often feel stress and nervousness. The lack of experience is one of the main reasons for these emotions.

- Solution Description:
Our project allows candidates not only to solve practice questions, the main function is ability to pass mock interviews with an AI. Questions that are similar to those that are usually asked in real interviews and then provided with feedback. Moreover, to imitate the real interview, the candidate will be able to answer through his microphone and receive questions via audio too.

- Benefits to Users:
Users will be able to prepare for future job interviews. Understand the skills that are needed to secure the job and go through the interviews being ready and not to be nervous.

- Differentiation:
Our product is going to imitate the real interview using AI. Interviews will include the candidate answering through their microphone and getting questions via audio too. Give the user detailed feedback and show the room for improvement.

- User Impact:
Our project in a broader sense will allow people to easily get ready for interviews and get a glimpse and experience of going through an interview. 

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
People often do not know what to expect from a job interview, especially if they never did it. They tend to get nervous and the lack of experience makes them even more nervous. Our project will allow such people to get near real experience of a job interview.

## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

1. What problem or need does your software project address?
The need for people to experience what a real interview is like and how to successfully go through it.
2. Who are your target users or customers?
People who want to get ready for a job interview.
3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?
Our team will ask other students to pass through a mock interview and give their feedback.
4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
Again, the main metric will be the feedback of other people and our teamâ€™s subject opinion.
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?
Our team will try to adapt to the feedback and adjust the product for targeted audience

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

- AI (Artificial Intelligence):
    - Voice the question to the candidate;
    - Recognize the voice of a candidate and convert it to text for an AI;
    - Rate the correctness of the candidates answer.
- Open-Source:
    - OpenAI
    - [coqui-ai](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) - translates text into sound with high quality and the voice sounds like a human voice
    - speech_recognition lib - translates sound into text with high quality
    - Hugging face - extremely powerful and large system. It will be really helpful for our project
    - Transformers - for comparing semantic similarity of the texts. Our team use this open source solution because our team needs powerful pretrained models
- Experts in relevant domains:
    - Rustam Lukmanov: instructor of Capstone Project course, to address the issues our team might face during development of the project.

## **Inviting Other Students**

For now, our team does not think it will need any collaboration in developing the software from other students. However, for validation and metrics the feedback and opinion of other students will be needed.

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

- Overview:
The project is about creating mock job interviews with an AI that functions as an interviewer. It allows people to get ready to future job interviews via near-real job interview experience.

- Schematic Drawing:
![Schematic Drawing](/../../static/MockMentor/schematic_drawing.svg)

- Tech Stack:
For now, we decided to use these stacks/frameworks for our project:
    - Frontend: 
        - React, react-dom, Redux - frameworks that our team is the most familiar with
    - Backend: 
        - FastAPI - simle and asynchronic, has a swagger and can integrate with pydantic
        - PostgreSQL - because our model have a clear and simple structure 
    - ML: 
        - Python - because its the easiest tool that our team is familiar with
        - Pytorch - because it is extremely popular and powerful and  our machine learning engineers are well known with this framework

- Anticipating Future Problems:
The testing and validating of an AI to successfully rate and give useful feedback will be needed to thoroughly parameterized. Therefore, other students will be asked to test the product and give feedback.

- Elaborate Explanations:
Our team will use Scrum and Agile methodology. Core functionality of the project is to provide a client a mock interview with an AI with feedback. The unique aspect of our solution is that client is able to go through interview by talking and receiving a voiced answer from an AI.

**Feedback**  
It is an interesting project! Great job on identifying the problem that candidates face in job interviews and proposing a solution to address it. Your project aims to bridge the gap between traditional practice questions and real interview experience, providing users with an opportunity to simulate mock interviews with an AI. This approach can greatly benefit candidates by allowing them to practice in a more realistic setting and receive valuable feedback, and perhaps, will make Innopolis students the most in-demand among other University graduates.

To further enhance your project, consider expanding on the specific features and functionalities that will be offered to users. How will the AI simulate real interview questions? Will it adapt based on the candidate's responses? Additionally, highlighting the personalized feedback aspect can emphasize the value users will gain from the platform.

Will it be a language model with a dedicated persona? Which language model you want to use? In general, I think you can contact Vladimir Ivanov, as far as I know, he works on a similar topic

# **Week #2**

{{< hint danger >}}
## **Week 2 - Choosing the Tech Stack, Designing the Architecture**

### **Tech Stack Selection**

- Tech Stack:
For now, we decided to use these stacks/frameworks for our project:
    - Frontend: 
        - React, react-dom, Redux, Typescript - frameworks that our team is the most familiar with
    - Backend: 
        - FastAPI - simle and asynchronic, has a swagger and can integrate with pydantic
        - PostgreSQL - because our model have a clear and simple structure 
        - pydantic - fast and supports type annotation
        - sqlMolde - new ORM that support type annotation, with total compatibility with pydantic and sqlAlchemy
    - ML: 
        - Python - and most of ML related libraries
        - Pytorch - because it is extremely popular and powerful and  our machine learning engineers are well known with this framework

### **Architecture Design**

1. **Component Breakdown**: There're three major components that will form our software solution: frontend, backend and ML. As can be expected, 
    - Frontend interacts with the user;
    - Backend serves as a bridge between frontend and ML, focuses on API and back-end logic;
    - ML performs three main functions: 
        - Converts the questions and feedback of an interviewer text-to-speech;
        - Converts the answers of the user speech-to-text;
        - Using NLP model will rate the correctness of user's answer and highlight the errors of the user.

2. **Data Management**: Data will be stored in a postrgres Database. There the questions, answers and a REFERENCE to audio files(questions and answers) will be stored.

3. **User Interface (UI) Design**: Our UI will be a simple chat-looking page with additional feature to write and compile user's code. Below you can see how it will look like.
![webpage_ex1](/../../static/MockMentor/webpage_ex1.jpg)
![webpage_ex2](/../../static/MockMentor/webpage_ex2.jpg)

4. **Integration and APIs**: RestAPI will be used for communication between frontend and backend. Backend and ML service will communicate through grpc. 

5. **Scalability and Performance**: Our project is built on microsystems, therefore it will be easily scalable. For example, we can just increase the number of instances of ML service. As each part of the project is done separately, we can increase the power of each part distinctively.

6. **Security and Privacy**: Right now, there is no security measures. There's no authentication, authorization and encryption. In future we are planning to add all of this and use jwt token.

7. **Error Handling and Resilience**: For now, there is no monetoring system but in future we are planning to add sentry to monitor the errors. All important events in the system will be logged.

8. **Deployment and DevOps**: Right now, there is now deployment and DevOps. In future, we are planning to add CI/CD and deploy via Kubernetes.

## **Week 2 questionnaire:**  

1) Tech Stack Resources: Are you utilizing any **project-based books** that specifically cover your tech stack and help you build your project? If yes, please provide the names of these books (name at least 3). How do you anticipate utilizing these materials to enhance your knowledge and expertise in your tech stack?
Right now, we do not utilize any project-based books.

2) Mentorship Support: Do you currently have a mentor actively involved in your project? If yes, kindly share the name of your mentor and explain how their guidance has positively influenced your project. If you don't have a mentor yet, have you considered seeking one? How do you believe having a mentor could contribute to the success of your project? Remember, having an experienced mentor that can guide you and your team is your responsibility.
Right now, we do not feel a need in a mentor. However, if problems will arise, our team is planning on contacting professor Vladimir Ivanov for help as a mentor.

3) Exploring Alternative Resources: In addition to project-based books, what other resources have you explored to expand your understanding of your tech stack? This could include online courses, video tutorials, documentation, or any other sources that have been valuable in filling knowledge gaps. Please, name at least 3 resources
- Design: To create a decent 'material' style design, we used sites to browse palettes and find appropriate colors. Mainly, Design team followed the guide on https://m3.material.io/. Our designer also mastered the basics of working with Figma, including how to make prototypes and animations. To complete this task, they watched several videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gofICZUqltY&t=155s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20IfkyJigKg.
- Frontend: For learning typescript and react frontend team watched videos on UlbiTV YouTube channel and read the official documentation. 
- Backend: Stepik and hexplet is where our Backend learned their stack from. Official documentantion of frameworks and libraries also helped
- ML: ML team used stepik course(https://stepik.org/course/92488/promo?search=2283969634) for a general understanding of neural networks and for working with audio. Also this course(https://stepik.org/course/54098/syllabus) was used understanding what is NLP and how it works. Our ML team used this documentation (https://huggingface.co/) to understand how transformers work.

4) Identifying Knowledge Gaps: Are there any specific areas within your tech stack where you or your team feel there are knowledge gaps or expertise is lacking? If so, how do you plan to address these gaps and ensure a well-rounded understanding of your chosen technologies? Please name the tech stack division in your team and outline how are you planning to deal with **knowledge gaps**
- Design: For now, our designer has no problems with working on project. However, if there will be any technical issues he is planning to use video guides and courses.
- Frontend: Our team is planning to read the documentation, watch video guides and if error occurs - find answers via StackOverflow
- Backend: Our backend team is struggling with working in a cloud. To deal with it, they are planning to pass the Yandex course about using their cloud service.
- ML: There is need to deepen the understanding of some models and embeddings. To deal with this our team is planning to read some articles and documentation (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/11/guide-word-embedding-techniques-nlp.html
https://medium.com/nlplanet/two-minutes-nlp-11-word-embeddings-models-you-should-know-a0581763b9a9)

5) Engaging with the Tech Community: Have you actively engaged with the broader tech community to seek guidance or learn from experienced professionals in your tech stack? This could involve participating in online forums and groups (telegram, discord or any other platform), attending local meetups (Kazan, Innopolis)? Do you have means to engage experts into critical tech stack problems through professional networks?
Not really, right now, we do not face any problems and see no need in such guidance.

6) Learning Objectives: What specific learning objectives have you set for yourself and your team in relation to your tech stack this week? How do you plan to achieve these objectives, and what strategies or resources will you employ to deepen your understanding?
There is a list of learning objectives and things that our team learned this week.
- Design: How to design websites and use Figma for designing them. Also, basic animation skills in Figma
- Front: How to work with components in react, how to make routing in react 18. 
- ML: Our ML team have learnt how to work with TTS library (https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) and how to convert speech to text using different approaches. Now we want to learn about semantic comparison of 2 texts. (https://towardsdatascience.com/semantic-textual-similarity-83b3ca4a840e) (https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity)
- Backend: For now, backend team is building an architecture of our project and making and decomposing tasks

7) Sharing Knowledge with Peers: How have you been sharing your knowledge and expertise with your teammates? Have you organized any knowledge-sharing sessions or discussions to facilitate the exchange of insights and experiences related to your tech stack?
Yes, our team organizes several meetings throughout the week to discuss both objectives and results of each week and sessions to discuss every stack in particular.

8) How have you leveraged AI to compensate for any lacking expertise in your tech stack? Have you utilized AI-powered tools or platforms to expedite the process of acquiring knowledge and expertise in your tech stack?
Right now, we do not use any ChatGPT-like products. However, we use several AI libraries and open source materials that might help in our project including text-to-speech, speech-to-text and others.
