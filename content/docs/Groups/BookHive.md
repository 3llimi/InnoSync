BookHive
Week 1 report
This week, our main task was to form a balanced all-around team and choose the general theme and outline of our project. Creating a team was not hard, as we mostly already knew each other and our strengths. Below is the list of our members and the roles they can fill out during project development:

Team Member Telegram ID Email Address Stack

Anastasia Martynova (Lead)  @zefirush   a.martynova@innopolis.university  Design/Frontend

Maxim Piniagin    @Ozurexus   m.piniagin@innopolis.university   Frontend/Product Manager

Yegor Sokolov    @yeawouu     ye.sokolov@innopolis.university   Backend

Marat Medvedev   @DuckBlur    m.medvedev@innopolis.university  Backend/ML

Lev Gorbunkov    @levgo1337   l.gorbunkov@innopolis.university Frontend/Backend

Bulat Kutlugallyamov   @bulatok4  b.kutlugallyamov@innopolis.university  Backend

Roman Voronov     @porludom   ro.voronov@innopolis.university Backend/ML


As you can see, we have an assortment of stack variations, and we believe that this will be an advantage during development.
While choosing the project idea, basically everyone had suggestions: we thought about making a site for prediction of currency exchange rate, considered making site+telegram bot for prediction of prices on online shops such as WildBerries. At some point, we even considered making a site for automatic note creation from the user uploaded mp3 file.
In the end, we settled on something that in our opinion has a higher chance of being a useful project: a book recommendation site (web/ML project). After finishing a book they really liked, many people have problems finding a similar one, and we aim to aid in that. Here is the brief rundown of the main features of this project:
The user enters a book they finished reading and whether they liked it or not. Based on that, our site proposes books that the user has not read and that might be interesting for them using Machine Learning Algorithm.
Each book will contain genre, abstract and links to its page in several online bookshops: both in digital and on paper.
Moreover, we plan to have some open source books be available for download directly from our site. Also hope that if this project will work out to get rights to sell books there.
More features may be added further down the line, when it will be easier to assess how much time we have after implementing the main ones, among those we consider implementing book crossing, however we first will measure the need for it to decide whether it is worth implementing or not.

To summarize, the problem we are solving is the difficulty to find similar books. The target audience for our project is people who read books. To test our assumptions, we are planning to try this on ourselves and see whether proposed books will be a good fit for us. The metrics for our project will be the amount of site users and their satisfaction with the recommendations. It is currently hard to make plans how to iterate our project, as this will mostly depend on the feedback we will be getting.

The book recommendation algorithm will be AI-based, the GitHub repository will be most likely open, and since we have a Machine Learning algorithm we will have two dedicated ML developers in our team. We are confident that we can complete the project by ourselves without other teamsâ€™ help.

The simplistic vision of how our project will function will be provided next week.
