# Mushroomity #

Hello! We're an international team that will create an application called `Mushroomity`. This application
will identify the type of some mushroom by its photo and location.

## Team Formation and Project Proposal ##

To create the application our team contains ML-engineers for creating ML-model to identify mushrooms and
Flutter-developers who will create the mobile application.

### Value Proposition ###
Our app solves the problem of identifying the type of mushroom by photo and location. It is a common issue for mushroom
hunters, farmers, and even ordinary people to identify the types of mushrooms they come across. Our app provides a
solution to this issue by using AI to recognize the type of mushroom from a photo and location data. Our app is unique
because it provides an accurate and reliable identification of mushrooms, which is not available in existing
alternatives.
- Identify the Problem: Lots of people make mistakes while collecting some mushrooms. Only in Russia there are thousands
people are poisoned by mushrooms and decimals even die.
- Solution Description: We will create an app that identifies the type of mushroom and says if it's eatable or not.
- Benefits to Users: Our app enhances the safety of mushroom hunters and farmers by providing accurate identification of
mushrooms. It also helps people to learn about different types of mushrooms and avoid consuming poisonous ones. Our app
is user-friendly and provides a seamless experience to users.
- Differentiation: Our app stands out from competing solutions because it uses AI to accurately identify the type of
mushroom. Existing alternatives rely on manual identification, which is time-consuming and less reliable. 
- User Impact: Our app has a positive impact on the safety of mushroom hunters, farmers, and ordinary people. It also
helps to promote awareness about different types of mushrooms and their characteristics.
- User Testimonials or Use Cases: We will collect user feedback and testimonials to demonstrate the value and benefits
of our app. We will also provide case studies of successful identifications and how our app has helped users.

## Lean Startup Methodology ##
Our software project addresses the problem of identifying the type of mushroom by photo and location. 

Our target users are mushroom hunters, farmers, and ordinary people who come across mushrooms and want to identify them. 

We will contact specialists in this area to identify good datasets for our model. Also, we will conduct user testing and
collect feedback to validate and test our assumptions about the project.

We will measure the success of our project by the number of accurate identifications, user engagement, and user
feedback. Of course, we don't want to make some life in dangerous, thus we will focus on types of mushrooms that are
poisoned.

We will use user feedback to improve our app and iterate on its features and functionalities. 

## Defining the Vision for Your Project ##
- Overview: Our app uses AI to identify the type of mushroom by photo and location. Users can take a photo of the
mushroom and provide location data, and our app will provide an accurate identification of the mushroom. 
- Schematic Drawings: Our app consists of a user interface, an AI algorithm for mushroom identification, and a database
of mushroom types. The user interface allows users to take a photo and provide location data. The AI algorithm processes
the photo and location data to identify the type of mushroom. The database provides information about different types of
mushrooms. 
- Tech Stack: Our app uses Python for the AI algorithm, Flutter for the user interface, and Postgresql for the database.
- Anticipating Future Problems: We anticipate potential problems related to the accuracy of identification and user
engagement. We will mitigate these problems by improving the AI algorithm and user interface. 
- Elaborate Explanations: Our AI algorithm uses computer vision and machine learning to identify the type of mushroom
from a photo. It analyzes the shape, color, and texture of the mushroom to provide an accurate identification. The
database provides information about different types of mushrooms, including their characteristics and toxicity levels.
Our app is unique because it provides an accurate and reliable identification of mushrooms even in offline form, which
is not available in existing alternatives.
