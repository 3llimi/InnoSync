### **Value Proposition**

#### Identify the Problem:
For decades, chemical scientists and students have wasted their time on converting compound representations from one form to another. It is not only a problem of wasting several minutes per formula, but also the fact that the algorithms for such conversions are pretty complex and require students to study them for about half a year before they can be applied. Even experienced scientists can make errors due to human factors, so double-checking the formula is usually required. People also tend to forget things, so they need to restudy the algorithm from time to time. Additionally, sometimes even non-chemistry people need to do some chemistry, but the main obstacle for them may be not knowing how to identify the name of the molecule from a drawing, as well as not having enough time to learn how to do it.

#### Solution Description:
To provide the most user-friendly experience possible, we need a mobile application that can instantly name a compound and provide its simple string notation (e.g. SMILES/InChl/IUPAC) by just taking a picture of its graphical representation.

#### Benefits to Users:
With this solution all three groups of users will be satisfied:
- Scientists will no longer waste their precious time doing mechanical work.
- Students can study less boring material.
- Non-chemistry people now have no barriers to doing basic chemistry.

#### Differentiation:
There are already some applications that solve a part of this problem. The closest analog is the "Organic Compound Identifier" app, but it does not detect the compound from the photo/drawing. Rather, it prompts the user to input the formula in the graph form by placing predetermined blocks of atoms and then connecting them. It is also limited to organic compounds only. Our application, on the other hand, is general-purpose for any compound, faster to apply, and easier to use.

#### User Impact:
The major impact is made on students. While they still need to study the principles of compound representation conversions, now knowing only the essentials reduces the half-year course to several weeks. Scientists will be able to concentrate more on the research they are doing, spending no time identifying and searching for molecules in the database by hand. Lastly, now even inexperienced people can be involved in some parts of science.

Overall, all the positive impact leads us to a faster growth of this science in both aspects: study and researching, as well as simplification of some domains of chemistry.

#### Use Cases:
1. Scientist
- A chemical scientist working on a research project needs to identify a compound from a graphical representation. She opens the app, takes a picture of the compound, and obtains its name and linear notation instantly, saving her time and effort.
- Another chemical scientist is looking at a molecule structure in a conference presentation but cannot recognize it. He quickly takes a photo of it using the app and gets an accurate name and SMILES string.

2. Students
- A chemistry student is practicing identifying compounds from graphical representations as part of their homework assignment. Instead of manually converting them one by one, he uses the app to take photos of each one and quickly get their names and SMILES notations.
- While studying for an exam, a chemistry student comes across a compound that she is unfamiliar with. She scans its representation into the app, receives its name and SMILES string, and can continue with her studies.

3. Non-Chemistry people
- A user is browsing social media and sees an interesting post about a molecular structure. They snap a picture of it, and the app identifies the compound, providing them with its name and SMILES notation, which they can then share with others or look up for more information.
- A person is planning a DIY home project that involves using different chemicals. Given the idea, they saw in a chemistry book, but it was made for professionals and some compounds are just drawn with no naming. So they can use this app to easily determine the names of the needed compounds (or if there is no name, just SMILES notation), so now they can search for them on the internet.

This can affect the overall performance and scalability of our application. Additionally, integrating a complex model with the mobile application UI can be technically challenging and may require significant modifications to the existing codebase.

Mitigation strategy: To address these challenges, we will consider optimizing our model by reducing its size and improving its processing speed. We may also explore using pre-trained models or, in the worst case we plan to use cloud-based services (because the main point is to remain autonomus) to offload some of the computational workload. Furthermore, we can break down the integration process into smaller, manageable tasks that can be implemented incrementally and tested thoroughly.

2. External dependencies - Our project may depend on external factors such as third-party APIs, data sources, or platform-specific requirements. Any changes or disruptions in these dependencies can impact the functionality and reliability of our application.
