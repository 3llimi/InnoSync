# Week 4 #

## External Feedback ##

We have found some testers from the Russian community who are ready to start using our application and provide feedback.
We hope that they will be of great assistance, especially since some of them are experts in mycology. Unfortunately, our
prototype is not yet complete, but we are working diligently to finish it as quickly as possible so that we can provide
the application to our testers next week.

## Testing ##

In general, we did not dedicate a significant amount of time to testing the app due to a lack of available resources.
Here are some details regarding this matter.

### Flutter ###

This week, we only connected the linter for the project. Our plan for next week is to include automated tests for the
project, focusing on the app's core functionality while our friends use the prototype.

### ML ###

This week, our focus was on creating the dataset. Therefore, we did not spend much time considering how to test our AI
model.

## Iteration ##

As you may recall, this week can be considered as the first iteration of our project. We made some minor changes to the
design (refer to the week 3 report), focused on the main functionality of the application, and created the dataset.
Since we aim to provide the prototype to our testers as soon as possible, we are dedicating a significant amount of time
to implementing the main functions and creating the server for storing photos and adding users.
