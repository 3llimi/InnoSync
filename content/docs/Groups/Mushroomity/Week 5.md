# Week 5 #

During this week, our team focused on working with the application and upgrading the AI model. We also received valuable
feedback from our testers, which helped us gain insights into our mistakes and how to rectify them.

updated for the testers during the week)

At the beginning of the week, we shared our prototype with the testers we had recruited two weeks ago. We allowed them
to install the application and analyze various mushrooms. Initially, our AI model was trained to determine only 100
types of mushrooms, resulting in numerous mistakes by our testers. However, we prioritized the usability of the
application over its correctness.

One issue we encountered was that three photos provided by the sample users were too large. As a result, the users
struggled to capture the mushrooms in the best possible way, leading to suboptimal images for analysis by the model.
Consequently, the model faced difficulties in accurately analyzing these photos.

In terms of feedback collection, we made the mistake of not collecting answers to specific questions from our testers.
Instead, we simply waited for any feedback they could provide. However, this approach proved to be inadequate as users
primarily reported problems that we were already aware of. Despite informing them that the model was not performing
well, users still struggled to understand all the mushrooms correctly. Additionally, some users found it challenging to
articulate their feedback effectively. To address these issues, we have decided to create forms with specific questions
for users to answer, ensuring better feedback collection in the future.

Moving forward, our focus for the upcoming week will be on updating the application to improve its appearance and
performance for our users. We plan to add more features, particularly descriptions for as many types of mushrooms as we
can complete.
