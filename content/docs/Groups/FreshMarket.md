# **FreshMarket**
# **Introduction**
 
Fresh Market is a marketplace of farm products with the possibility of subscription. Customers see the assortment of regional farm products and collect products in the basket for ordering. Farmers post products with photos, descriptions, quantities and the possibility of subscribing to their products. When placing an order, the buyer chooses payment by card, cash or invoice for the organization and chooses the delivery method courier, pickup or transport company. The farmer receives his funds the next day after the delivery of the goods to the card attached to the profile.

### **Value Proposition**

1. **The problem:** In grocery stores, purchasing directors choose large suppliers who win the competition at the expense of not purely grown animals and products. Farmers with excessive production are forced to find their customers in chat rooms in messengers. Buyers want to buy fresh and cleanly grown products, but there are no guarantees in the delivery of the product after transferring funds directly to the farmer's account.

2. **Solution:** Fresh Market is a marketplace of farm products with the possibility of subscription. Customers see the assortment of regional farm products and collect products in the basket for ordering. Farmers post products with photos, descriptions, quantities and the possibility of subscribing to their products. When placing an order, the buyer chooses payment by card, cash or invoice for the organization and chooses the delivery method courier, pickup or transport company. The farmer receives his funds the next day after the delivery of the goods to the card attached to the profile. The most adequate and working store on the Russian market is esh-derevenskoe.ru , but they do not work with a subscription in any way and cannot give regular customers to their suppliers.

3. **Advantages for the parties:** We are intermediaries between the buyer and the farmer, which gives security in both directions: the farmer will receive money only for a quality product, the buyer will give money only for a quality product. It is easier and more variable for the buyer to choose and order goods, and the farmer does not have to worry about promotion, because buyers see his products, rating and reviews

4. **Differentiation:** A distinctive function from all other marketplaces of fresh farm products is a subscription for delivery, thanks to which the buyer knows that, for example, every week for a month he will have a dozen fresh chicken eggs, and the farmer knows that he has a planned demand for his products

5. **Impact on users:** Explain what broader impact your software project has on users and possibly on society or the industry as a whole. Highlight any positive changes, transformative effects or achievements that result from the implementation of your solution. Think about how it improves workflows, empowers users, or promotes positive change.

6. **Impact:** More users will have a reliable tool for buying fresh farm products, and more farmers will be able to commercialize their mini production without problems

7. **Interest:** The Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Tatarstan has shown interest in developing such a product for farmers of the republic, because now everyone really has to spam in chat rooms about their products

## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

1. *What problem or need does your software project address?*
**Answer:** Our software project solves the problem of finding potential customers or finding farmers to buy fresh products without spending a lot of time. Now it is more common to post such advertisements in messengers like WhatsApp or Telegram. So it makes it hard to find it efficiently, the central platform would be convenient.

2. *Who are your target users or customers?*
**Answer:** Our target users/customers are:
– farmers who want to sell products,
– people or companies (cafes, restaurants) who want to buy these products

3. *How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?*
**Answer:**  To validate and test our assumptions about the project, we will interview with people who often buy fresh products or farmers. We are going to ask them about how much time they usually spend on selling/buying and would it be more convenient for them if there will be one platform for this purpose specifically.

4. *What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?*
**Answer:** Metrics to measure the success of our project are the number of users that will register and use our platform and the feedback, which we will collect to ensure that this platform is convenient and needed.

5. *How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?*
**Answer:** Based on user feedback, we plan to iterate and pivot if necessary by changing the UI to make it more user-friendly, also we can add some new features, post more information about users and products if they need it.


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

For our project, **we don't really need** to use Artificial Intelligence, Open-Sources, or any sources with experts in relevant domains. For our domain, any of these resources will approach us to development or success. However, at some stage, to provide more useful and usable functions of our product to potential users, **we will need to interview** some farmer-workers to collect necessary data.

## **Inviting Other Students**

At this stage, **we have assembled a full team** of people covering all the positions needed for the project, so for now we are not planning to invite other students for our project. Nevertheless, in case of any specific situations, we are ready to collaborate with other people or teams to complete the product.

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

1. **Overview:** Provide a concise summary of your project, highlighting its purpose and value proposition. Explain how your project addresses a specific problem or need in the chosen domain. Clearly state the intended benefits and impact on users or stakeholders. 
Answer: Our project is a platform that helps farmers sell their products directly to consumers. By eliminating middlemen and offering a subscription model for customers, we connect farmers with a wider customer base. The platform addresses the problem of limited market access for farmers and offers benefits such as increased profitability, reduced dependency on intermediaries, and access to locally sourced produce for customers. Ultimately, our project aims to empower farmers, connect them with consumers, and create a sustainable ecosystem in the agricultural industry.

2. **Schematic Drawings:** Use visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, or wireframes to illustrate the structure and flow of your project. Include all essential components, modules, and interactions within the system. Ensure the drawings are clear, labeled, and easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

3. **Tech Stack:** Specify the technologies, frameworks, and programming languages you plan to utilize in your project. Justify your tech stack choices based on their suitability for the project requirements and team expertise. Consider scalability, performance, security, and ease of development when selecting your tech stack.
Answer: For the backend part (API) we have chosen the Django framework because it provides convenient ORM. As a database we decided to use PostgreSQL. Also to authorize requests to the backend part we will use JWT tokens. Visual part of our platform will be  written using Flutter because of its cross-platform usage. For the beginning we will create the website but then it will not be difficult to convert it to the mobile app. All these parts are good in both performance and ease of development.

4. **Anticipating Future Problems:** Foresee potential challenges and obstacles that may arise during the project development and deployment phases. Identify risks related to technical complexities, resource limitations, time constraints, or external dependencies. Propose mitigation strategies or alternative approaches to address these anticipated problems. 
Developing a platform that caters to both farmers and customers can be technically complex. There may be issues related to compatibility, scalability, and security. Talking about resource limitations, the project may require a significant amount of resources, including human resources, financial resources, and technological resources. Finally, we have some time constraints: the project may face delays due to unforeseen circumstances such as technical glitches or changes in requirements, and still for creating a MVP we have only seven weeks.
To deal with such problems, we should stick to following strategies: 
– Create a detailed project plan that outlines the required resources and allocate them accordingly, 
– Conduct regular testing and debugging to ensure the smooth functioning of the platform,
– Set realistic timelines and milestones for each phase of the project. Regularly monitor progress and adjust timelines if necessary.

5. **Elaborate Explanations:** Provide detailed descriptions of critical components, algorithms, or methodologies employed in your project. Explain the core functionalities and how they contribute to achieving the project goals. Highlight any innovative or unique aspects of your solution that differentiate it from existing alternatives.
Answer: Our project employs the MVC template, JWT tokens for security, and a REST API. The MVC pattern separates the application into Model, View, and Controller components. JWT tokens provide secure authentication, while the REST API enables communication with well-defined endpoints. Core functionalities include user authentication, product listing and management, subscription model, and order management. Our solution stands out by facilitating direct farmer-consumer interaction, offering a subscription model, and ensuring secure authentication.

**Feedback**  
I think, your project is really cool! A long needed service that will benefit us all - by making as healthier through delivering high-quality farmer produce. Your team's dedication and strong collaboration are evident, and it's great to see that you have a clear vision for the project.

Considering that our course aims to achieve a minimal viable product (MVP) by the end of the semester, I would suggest, as to most teams, to focus on scaling down the project to create a web app that encompasses the core functionalities. This approach will allow you to build a solid foundation that can be expanded and enhanced in the future.

To ensure efficient execution within our limited timeframe of already six weeks, I recommend outlining the main features of your project and prioritizing their development. It's essential to identify specific areas that can be streamlined or simplified without compromising the core functionality.

Also, take a note that it is possible to utilize open-source as means of scaling down your project: for example, there is a multitude of open-source platforms for e-commerce: i.e. https://saleor.io/, https://strapi.io/ that you can use as a modular back-end. Although, I am not sure how rigid or flexible this solutions are. {{< /hint >}}
