## Value Proposition

<h3>Identify the Problem</h3>
The lack of a centralized resource for travelers in Russia leads to inconvenience and higher costs when using the services of private travel agencies.

<h3>Solution Description</h3>
The web application will allow users to plan trips and select attractions according to location or recommendations. It allows users to make a route plan, find an attraction by recommendations or search, and save all routes in a personal account.

<h3>Benefits to Users</h3>
Advantages for users in using our web application:
  1. No intermediaries: This allows users to save time and avoid additional fees.
  2. Personalized recommendations: The built-in artificial intelligence in our app suggests places and attractions that match the user's given parameters.
  3. Place search: user-friendly interface that allows you to select a place by name or location.
  4. Personal account: That provides the ability to add favourite places and plan routes of the trip.
   
<h3>Differentiation</h3>
The main difference between our project and popular analogues is the ability to save selected places in a private account, view and save ready-made routes, and a recommendation system based on artificial intelligence.

<h3>User Impact </h3>
The implementation of our application could have the following positive impacts on users, society, and the tourism industry in Russia:
  1. Increased accessibility: Our solution allows users to search and choose places without intermediaries
  2. Development of tourism in Russia: Travelers can increase the demand for local tourist facilities and services, because they will have an opportunity to plan and find interesting places to visit on their own
  3. Enhancing the travel experience: Our solution will help users to find sights and plan trips easily. Therefore, a greater number of tourists will be interested and plan their trip.
   
<h3>User Testimonials or Use Cases</h3>
  
There some use cases of our potential users:

Sasha wants to go to Kimchatka with friends this summer and has already started planning the trip. she doesn't want to miss any of the must-see attractions. so she uses the app to create a personalized itinerary based on her favorite activities and recommendations, and can save her itinerary to her personal account for easy access during her trip.

Ayaz has a few hours of free time to explore a new city where he comes for a business conference. He uses a web app to quickly find nearby attractions based on his interests and lifestyle. he can also save the selected attractions in his personal account and share his impressions of the places already visited.

Karina is a voyager/blogger who is continuously searching for intriguing locales to visit and afterward 
share with her adherents. She advantages from the web app to discover secret and lesser-known attractions in the towns she visits which are put away in her own account for utilization on her blog.


## Lean Startup Questionnaire
1. **What problem or need does your software project address?** It is hard to organize your vacation journey by yourself. It takes much time and responsibility and the fault cost is high. Analyzing yours and your friends interests and previous trips we can offer the best ways to spend your time on your vacation.
2. **Who are your target users or customers?** People in age between 20 and 35 who are interested and have financial opportunity to see the world. So mostly those people are from the middle and higher social classes.
3. **How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?** Firstly we should provide market research, test our product with a group of potential users, and we can use lean startup methodology to build our startup in the future.
4. **What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?** We will use DAU, MAU, Retention, NPS, CAC and LTV (in the best case) to measure the success of our product. Those metrics will help us to find out if users want to use our product regularly and they need this product.
5. **How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?** We will use the Build-Measure-Learn model, building small MVPs and prototypes we can measure if our product is useful for people and we can sell it in the future. In case we realized that our product is useless and people donâ€™t want to use it, we would pivot and change our plans.

## Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts

**AI (Artificial Intelligence):** We will use AI for creating recommendations of sights and places for users.
**Open-Source:** We do not plan to use Open-Source sources at this time.
**Experts in relevant domains:** At the moment we do not have any experts involved.

## Inviting Other Students

**Answers:**

Our team is not going to invite other students.

## Defining the Vision for Your Project

**Overview:**
Our web application will help travelers plan and organize their trips in Russia. Therefore,  the main goal of our project is to allow users to find interesting sights, create routes and save them in their personal account.

**Schematic Drawings:**
There are schematics drawings of the future functional with short description.

After authorization, the user can search places by name or use filters with AI. The main points of the AI logic at the moment are being discussed and will be provided together with the full design. Next, the user can see the search results, add places to favorites and save the object to the chosen trip.

**Tech Stack**

We will announce it on the second week of capstone project course

**Anticipating Future Problems**

1. During the development stages, our team may face a lack of experience with the software, as this application requires deep knowledge in backend development and advanced ML skills.
2. Limited resources: Also, we can face a lack of time, because there is only seven weeks to develop a project. Next, financial resources may be required for further development.

These problems can be solved with proper planning of tasks and time. Also, our team should have good soft skills to achieve the result. To solve financial problems, there are many Russian contests and grants to support innovative ideas, student projects, and so on

**Elaborate Explanations**
  
The application is built with a number of important components that work together to provide users with a comprehensive trip planning experience. 
These include:
  - Frontend subsystem: The web application with UI that allows users to see their profiles and recommendations. This subsystem will be connected with the backend part to provide full service functionality.
  - Backend subsystem: The application that communicates with the frontend UI and stores all user and application data.
  - ML/AI subsystem: The service (part of the backend or independent one) which uses ML to build and recommend comprehensive routes to our users. It will communicate with the Backend subsystem to get users data and give new routes.


# **Week 02 - report**

> Important note: Our team decided to change the name of our web application from "Triptastic" to "Voyagio". Therefore, we updated the name of the web application in our blog and the name of the branch in Github as well.

## Architecture Design
<h3>Component Breakdown: </h3>

For creating success application we should take the following components:
- UX/UI design
- Onboarding in mobile version component
- Authorization component
- Search component
- Machine Learning recommendation component
- Backend and database design component
- Personal account component
  
<h3>Data Management:</h3>
Our team will use PostgreSQL, a reliable and stable relational database, to store authorization data and user information. PostgreSQL is capable of handling large data volumes and concurrent connections that is important for multi users access. Additionally, it provides robust security features to protect stored data.

<h3>User Interface (UI) Design:</h3>
Based on analyzis of potential users, we created a user flows:
<p align="center">
<img src="/voyagio/userflow1.png" width="350">
<img src="/voyagio/userflow2.png" width="350">
</p>
Also, we started to create UI Design in Figma. Some mockups from the project:

If you are interested in seeing all of the designs in Figma, please contact Alexandra Chupkova (@KMnSO4) via private message.

<h3>Integration and APIs:</h3>
We do not plan to use external APIs in this project. Instead, we will store data about items in the database. However, to get initial dataset we are planning to use Scraper API.

<h3>Scalability and Performance:</h3>
We lay the load on the database for the ability to add social networking elements for travelers. However, with the successful development of the project and the startup opening, at this point we cannot predict the number of potential users. 

<h3>Security and Privacy:</h3>
To store authorization data in the PostgreSQL we will use security tools for this type of the database.

<h3>Error Handling and Resilience:</h3>
To prevent mistakes from we users we will use hadling mistakes on frontend side and add tooltips for users. For check coding mistakes, we will write tests on the frontend/backend.

<h3>Deployment and DevOps:</h3>
We have not decided yet. There are two ways: rent a server or start application locally. However, we will use containerisation to avoid mistakes with versions or different operation systems.

## Week 2 questionnaire

<h3>Tech Stack Resources:</h3> 
Our team does not use specifical project-based books. 

<h3>Mentorship Support: </h3>
In this time we are not planning to find mentor for our project. In our team there are people with experience in commercial projects, therefore, they can take role of the mentors for other teammates.

<h3>Exploring Alternative Resources: </h3>
To filling knowledge gaps we like usual way to find information: to learn something new teammates read articles, use Kaggle or watch guides on youtube.

<h3>Identify Knowledge Gaps: </h3>
Our team has identified two main knowledge gaps that require further exploration:

- Algorithm for recommendation systems
- Integration of a trained model with the backend
  
<h3>Engaging with the Tech Community: </h3>
Our team regularly participates in online and offline meetups and conferences related to their tech stack. Also we communicate with a professional community regularly visiting some professional resources, for example, Habr and Medium, and communicating with our collegues. Some members of our team is a large hackathones participants.

<h3>Learning Objectives:</h3>
By the end of this week, we plan to accomplish the following tasks: 

- create and set up github repository
- exploring concepts of machine learning algorithms
- creating main design concepts.

Our team utilize Scrum method with one-week sprints to handle teamwork. To track the progress of the team, we will use a Backlog to assign and split tasks. At the end of each sprint, we will hold meetings to review our results.

<h3>Sharing Knowledge with Peer: </h3>
We use division and mentorship approach inside a team to achive the optimal results. Each subteam consists of two members with one who has commercial or strong experience in the topic. This provides direct communication and knowledge sharing within the subteam, without involving the Project Manager. Also, we utilize telegram group for team communication, time schedulling and knowledge sharing.

<h3>AI utilizing:</h3>
We use OpenAI's ChatGPT to gain inspiration, save time, and receive hints in unexplored areas. Also, we used special AI for generate the name of the web-application, select infographics and color palettes.
