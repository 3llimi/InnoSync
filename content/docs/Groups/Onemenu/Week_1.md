Remember to keep your value proposition concise, clear, and compelling. Focus on the most significant benefits and outcomes that resonate with your target users. A well-crafted value proposition effectively communicates the value and impact of your software project, making it more appealing and compelling to users.

> Identify the Problem:

First pain point is a big amount of different websites, apps, and telegram chats for different restaurants. Our goal is to reduce their number to a unified powerful solution for better user experience. Second one is that almost none of the eating establishments have a loyalty system. Another problem we discovered is that no one  uses statistics to improve their efficiency. Lastly, clients experience discomfort, since they don’t have personalized recommendations while they are choosing what to order and where to order from. 

> Solution Description:

We propose a solution, where clients can view a list of different restaurants in one app. It makes the choice of the eateries easier. Also it reduces the number of applications used by a client.

Personalization for the client is also one of the ways to solve the problem. Our chat-bot will advise users what to order, because most times it’s hard to choose.

One app for a booking system, and an online menu is convenient. Integrated chat-bot will advise the establishment how to improve their business model based on the gathered statistics. Because of the personalization for users, chat-bot will be able to attract clients to the eateries.

> Benefits to users:

The first benefit for the user is that the user will have one list of all the eating establishments in our website (Telegram WebApp), so the clients won’t need to search somewhere else, or visit different sites to view a menu. It is time saving for the user. The second benefit is personalization. Users will have personalized recommendations and discounts from the eateries, and advising the dishes. Thirdly, since we will gather statistics, we will have the ability to share with customers, amount of each product to buy and which number of dishes to cook more etc. Additionally, our website will have a convenient online menu with a nice design, improving UI and UX.

> Differentiation:

Our competitive advantage for clients is that they will have  a personalized app and it will improve their experience a lot. Also nice design is a rare thing in apps like this. 

Our competitive advantage for eateries is that they will have personalized advice based on the statistics we gathered. It can improve the business model of the company which is crucial.

> User Impact:

Our app makes it easier for clients to discover new places to visit and to choose the dishes. The main impact on clients is that they will have a personalized app.

Our app improves the productivity of the eateries, because it allows the establishments to reduce the number of people working in your business. Moreover, it allows us to centralize all the systems at once. Advice from AI is a useful tool that improves the workflow. 

> User testimonials or Use Case:

The client came to the restaurant, but they didn't know what to order. The client asks the chat-bot what to order like: “Advise what to order for four people for less than 100 dollars.” Our chat-bot can advise the user dishes. And also it can help the eateries to sell what they have left more than should. It helps both of the sides. 

Another example is that the owner of the establishments doesn’t have a big profit, because his business model is not that profitable. Our AI can advise the way to improve the business model based on statistics. 


## **Lean Startup Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean startup methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address?
2. Who are your target users or customers?
3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?
4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?

> 1. What problem or need does your software project address?

Our project is aimed to develop a convenient environment for businesses in the food (restaurant) industry. The software we suggest is a system for companies allowing them to take orders automatically, get ratings and statistics, personalize the customers and special offers for them.

> 2. Who are your target users or customers?

Our target users are going to be the restaurant businesses and end users, i.e. customers of the restaurants using our software. The companies use our solution for unified order taking and their customers for convenient order making.

> 3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?

We will obtain the data of some certain cafe/restaurant, calculate metrics, analyze the info about sellings and revenue. Then provide the company with our product and evaluate the performance after some time. Compare the data and track the tendencies.

> 4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?

For the efficiency evaluation we will use the economic metrics which are supposed to be the main ones for any business, e.g., customer retention rate, average order value and the customer satisfaction index.

> 5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?

We will definitely design a process that allows users to give feedback regularly and ensure that the team is actively listening to their suggestions. Based on it, we will modify the trajectory of our further development. 


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Explain how your team plans to leverage the following resources for the development and success of your project:

- AI (Artificial Intelligence):
- Open-Source:
- Experts in relevant domains:

> AI:

We plan to use AI in several ways:

Firstly, we are going to introduce chat-bot helping users to choose dishes from the menu. It often happens that people don't know what to order and they only have vague desires such as “sweet coffee drink” or “lunch without soup under 500 rubles”. Here comes the chat-bot, which will take into consideration any client desire and provide suggestions. 

Second way to use AI is to collect and analyze data from the clients and provide them with personal offers such as fixed discounts on all the dishes or discounts on particular combos. We are going to use knowledge acquired during IML and STDSR courses to generate useful statistics and suggestions for the customers.

Lastly, we plan to speed up our development using tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, DALLE, etc. They will help us with bug-fixing, test coverage, meaningful picture placeholder generation and other labor work.

> Open-source:

We plan to use tailwind css framework as it is providing comprehensive designs for free and it will be very helpful due to the lack of time for the project. For the development part, we will use open source libraries for frontend (React), backend (Pyrogram, Flask), ML (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, etc.) For the deployment part, we are planning to use docker.

> Experts in relevant domain:

- Andrei Markov - backend specialist, he will help us resolving issues with database scheme
- Rustam Lukmanov - ML specialist, he will help suggest us on ML problems



## **Inviting Other Students**

Are you open to inviting other students to join your project? If so, it's great to foster collaboration and expand your team. Feel free to discuss the project with your peers and encourage them to join if they are interested and motivated.

When considering inviting other students, you can think about the roles you are looking for and any specific requirements. Be open to diverse skills and expertise that can contribute to the success of your project. Collaboration and teamwork can lead to innovative solutions and a richer learning experience.

Remember, talking to other students and finding potential team members to join your project is not only allowed but also encouraged. Embrace the opportunity to collaborate and create a strong team that can achieve great results together.

> Solution:

We plan to invite some students for help in particular parts of our project such as database schema creation and ML-algorithm implementations, since we might not have enough expertise in those fields.


## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

A clear and compelling vision is crucial for successful project planning. When you have a well-defined concept and a shared vision of what you aim to achieve, executing on that vision becomes significantly easier. Therefore, after thorough discussions and settling on a promising idea, it is essential to craft a comprehensive vision with your team. This vision should be detailed, encompassing your chosen tech stack, and anticipate potential future challenges. Below, describe your project using schematic drawings and provide elaborate explanations of all significant components.

- Overview:
Provide a concise summary of your project, highlighting its purpose and value proposition.
Explain how your project addresses a specific problem or need in the chosen domain.
Clearly state the intended benefits and impact on users or stakeholders.

- Schematic Drawings:
Use visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, or wireframes to illustrate the structure and flow of your project.
Include all essential components, modules, and interactions within the system.
Ensure the drawings are clear, labeled, and easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- Tech Stack:
Specify the technologies, frameworks, and programming languages you plan to utilize in your project.
Justify your tech stack choices based on their suitability for the project requirements and team expertise.
Consider scalability, performance, security, and ease of development when selecting your tech stack.

- Anticipating Future Problems:
Foresee potential challenges and obstacles that may arise during the project development and deployment phases.
Identify risks related to technical complexities, resource limitations, time constraints, or external dependencies.
Propose mitigation strategies or alternative approaches to address these anticipated problems.

 Elaborate Explanations:
Provide detailed descriptions of critical components, algorithms, or methodologies employed in your project.
Explain the core functionalities and how they contribute to achieving the project goals.
Highlight any innovative or unique aspects of your solution that differentiate it from existing alternatives.

> Overview:

We provide a simple and unified solution for ordering food in restaurants. Telegram bot (with the usage of WebApp) will make it easier for users to interact with the restaurant, and will be able to provide personal offers for each user. AI assistant can help with the choice of dishes.

> Schematic Drawings:

![Our project scheme](/Onemenu/scheme.svg)

> Tech Stack:

We will use python for backend and ML because we are most experienced with it. For the server we will use the Flask framework, for telegram bot - Pyrogram. For frontend we will use JavaScript React because we are also familiar with it.

> Anticipating Future Problems:

One major problem of all software projects is unclear architecture. If we choose the wrong structure of our project now, then, in the future, it would be hard to maintain and develop the product. Moreover, if during the development it turns out that the architecture is unsuitable for our project, then the project will be unfinished. To avoid this, we will thoroughly choose the architecture and development stack in the beginning, and if we find any problems with our choice, we will make corrections as fast as possible to avoid problems in future.

> Elaborate Explanations:

Our app consists of 3 components: backend server, telegram bot, website. Website and bot will do essentially the same thing: clients will interact with them to order dishes, and restaurant staff will see available orders. Server will be used to process inputs from bot and website, and also for ML (analytics).
