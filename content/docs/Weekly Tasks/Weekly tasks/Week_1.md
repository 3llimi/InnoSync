**Week #1 is the most crucial week of the entire semester as it sets the foundation for your project**. During this week, your primary tasks are to form your team and select a project. The team formation process should carefully consider the skills, expertise, and compatibility of team members to ensure effective collaboration.

Once your team is formed, it is essential to pitch and discuss project ideas among yourselves. Select a project that aligns with one of the three tiers: web, mobile, or ML (machine learning). The chosen project should be well-defined, feasible, and have a clear problem statement.

Additionally, we expect each team to maintain a weekly progress report blog. These reports are a crucial means of tracking the progress of your projects. Each team is required to submit a report no later than Friday 18:00 of each week. The reports should be informative, substantive, and provide a detailed account of your progress. It is important to clearly explain what you have accomplished, how you have achieved it, and any obstacles or challenges you have encountered.

These weekly reports will be evaluated, and feedback will be provided to assist you in the successful completion of your projects. Therefore, it is crucial to submit your reports on time and ensure they reflect the substantial progress you have made throughout the week.

We encourage you to use this blog as a platform to share your accomplishments, insights, and challenges. It is a valuable opportunity to communicate your ideas, seek feedback, and engage with your peers. By actively participating and sharing your experiences, you contribute to the collaborative learning environment we aim to foster.

Whenever possible, provide real-world examples, user testimonials, or case studies that demonstrate the value and benefits of your software project. Showcasing tangible results and success stories adds credibility and reinforces the value proposition.

Remember to keep your value proposition concise, clear, and compelling. Focus on the most significant benefits and outcomes that resonate with your target users. A well-crafted value proposition effectively communicates the value and impact of your software project, making it more appealing and compelling to users.

- The problem: 
Difficulty in rapidly and accurately recognizing the markings of pipeline elements based on their photo images.

- Solution Description:
Our project offers a video analytics module that automatically recognizes the marking of pipeline and metal elements.
The solution is unique within the projects we have been acquainted with.

- Benefits to Users:
Increased speed and accuracy of mark recognition, reduced errors, high productivity.

- Differentiation:
We did not find any similar projects in open sources. Anyway, here are selling points for our solution. Our system integrates with a database to store and retrieve the recognition results, which makes it a more comprehensive solution. Also, the solution has user-friendly interface that is appropriate to the customer.

- User Impact:
With this automated pipeline marking recognition system, professionals can significantly reduce the time and effort spent on manual and error-prone recognition tasks. This automation leads to higher productivity and cost savings.
Furthermore, the increased accuracy provided by our software reduces the risk of incorrect identification of pipeline markings, which could potentially lead to costly or even dangerous mistakes in pipeline construction or maintenance. Thus, our solution not only improves efficiency but also enhances safety in the industry.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
At this early stage of the project, we might not have real-world examples or user testimonials due to no interaction with the customer. But there is hypothetical use case based on our understanding of the industry and the problem we’re addressing:
"A pipeline construction company used our software to automatically recognize and catalog the markings on their pipeline components. They reported a 50% reduction in the time spent on these tasks, along with a significant decrease in recognition errors. This improvement allowed them to speed up their construction projects and reduce costs associated with errors."

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

A clear and compelling vision is crucial for successful project planning. When you have a well-defined concept and a shared vision of what you aim to achieve, executing on that vision becomes significantly easier. Therefore, after thorough discussions and settling on a promising idea, it is essential to craft a comprehensive vision with your team. This vision should be detailed, encompassing your chosen tech stack, and anticipate potential future challenges. Below, describe your project using schematic drawings and provide elaborate explanations of all significant components.

- Overview:
Provide a concise summary of your project, highlighting its purpose and value proposition.
Explain how your project addresses a specific problem or need in the chosen domain.
Clearly state the intended benefits and impact on users or stakeholders.

- Schematic Drawings:
Use visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, or wireframes to illustrate the structure and flow of your project.
Include all essential components, modules, and interactions within the system.
Ensure the drawings are clear, labeled, and easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- Tech Stack:
Specify the technologies, frameworks, and programming languages you plan to utilize in your project.
Justify your tech stack choices based on their suitability for the project requirements and team expertise.
Consider scalability, performance, security, and ease of development when selecting your tech stack.

- Anticipating Future Problems:
Foresee potential challenges and obstacles that may arise during the project development and deployment phases.
Identify risks related to technical complexities, resource limitations, time constraints, or external dependencies.
Propose mitigation strategies or alternative approaches to address these anticipated problems.

- Elaborate Explanations:

- Overview: 
The project aims to develop an automated pipeline marking recognition system based on a neural network. The system addresses the challenge of manual pipeline and metal marking recognition, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Our solution provides automated, fast, and accurate recognition, enhancing productivity, reducing errors, and potentially improving safety in the pipeline construction and maintenance industry.

- Schematic Drawings:
![Schematic drawing](/PipeVision/schematicDrawing.png "Schema").

- Tech Stack:
The backend of the application will be developed using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for image processing and machine learning, such as OpenCV and PyTorch or TensorFlow. The frontend will be built using a JavaScript framework React for its efficiency and flexibility. PostgreSQL will serve as the database management system due to its robustness and excellent performance. The neural network will be trained using YOLO, which is an efficient and effective object detection model.

- Anticipating Future Problems:
Potential challenges may include obtaining enough quality data for training the neural network, ensuring the system can handle a large number of users or requests simultaneously, and ensuring the recognition accuracy is high enough to be useful in a real-world setting. Strategies to address these challenges could include data augmentation techniques, using a scalable backend framework, and continually improving and updating the neural network model based on user feedback and new data.

- Elaborate Explanations:
Our application can be divided into four main components: the frontend interface, the backend server, the database, and the neural network.
    1. The frontend interface allows users to upload images and view recognition results. It communicates with the backend server to send and receive data.
    2. The backend server handles requests from the frontend, processes images using the trained neural network, stores results in the database, and sends results back to the frontend.
    3. The PostgreSQL database keeps track of recognition results, allowing users to view past results and providing a source of data for further improvement of the neural network.
    4. The neural network is the heart of our system, responsible for recognizing pipeline markings in the images.
