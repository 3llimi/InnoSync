**Week #1 is the most crucial week of the entire semester as it sets the foundation for your project**. During this week, your primary tasks are to form your team and select a project. The team formation process should carefully consider the skills, expertise, and compatibility of team members to ensure effective collaboration.

Once your team is formed, it is essential to pitch and discuss project ideas among yourselves. Select a project that aligns with one of the three tiers: web, mobile, or ML (machine learning). The chosen project should be well-defined, feasible, and have a clear problem statement.

Additionally, we expect each team to maintain a weekly progress report blog. These reports are a crucial means of tracking the progress of your projects. Each team is required to submit a report no later than Friday 18:00 of each week. The reports should be informative, substantive, and provide a detailed account of your progress. It is important to clearly explain what you have accomplished, how you have achieved it, and any obstacles or challenges you have encountered.

These weekly reports will be evaluated, and feedback will be provided to assist you in the successful completion of your projects. Therefore, it is crucial to submit your reports on time and ensure they reflect the substantial progress you have made throughout the week.

We encourage you to use this blog as a platform to share your accomplishments, insights, and challenges. It is a valuable opportunity to communicate your ideas, seek feedback, and engage with your peers. By actively participating and sharing your experiences, you contribute to the collaborative learning environment we aim to foster.

#### Answers:

- Overview:

Our web application will help travelers plan and organize their trips in Russia. Therefore,  the main goal of our project is to allow users to find interesting sights, create routes and save them in their personal account.

- Schematic Drawings: There are schematics drawings of the future functional with short description.
After authorization, the user can search places by name or use filters with AI. The main points of the AI logic at the moment are being discussed and will be provided together with the full design. Next, the user can see the search results, add places to favorites and save the object to the chosen trip.

- Tech Stack:

We will announce it on the second week of capstone project course

- Anticipating Future Problems:

1. During the development stages, our team may face a lack of experience with the software, as this application requires deep knowledge in backend development and advanced ML skills.
2. Limited resources: Also, we can face a lack of time, because there is only seven weeks to develop a project. Next, financial resources may be required for further development.

These problems can be solved with proper planning of tasks and time. Also, our team should have good soft skills to achieve the result. To solve financial problems, there are many Russian contests and grants to support innovative ideas, student projects, and so on

- Elaborate Explanations:
  
The application is built with a number of important components that work together to provide users with a comprehensive trip planning experience. 
These include:
  - Frontend subsystem: The web application with UI that allows users to see their profiles and recommendations. This subsystem will be connected with the backend part to provide full service functionality.
  - Backend subsystem: The application that communicates with the frontend UI and stores all user and application data.
  - ML/AI subsystem: The service (part of the backend or independent one) which uses ML to build and recommend comprehensive routes to our users. It will communicate with the Backend subsystem to get users data and give new routes.
